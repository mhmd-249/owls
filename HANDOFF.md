## Key Decisions Made
- Tech stack: Next.js 14 frontend + Python FastAPI backend
- LLM: Claude Sonnet for agents (speed), Opus for aggregation (quality)
- No database — JSON files for profiles, in-memory for test sessions
- SSE for real-time streaming of agent responses
- 30 characters visible on screen, representing 200 agents
- Simple SVG characters with thought bubbles
