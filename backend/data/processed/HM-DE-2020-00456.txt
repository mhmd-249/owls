In a recent review (rated 4/5), you said: "The cargo pants are literally SO good for the price. The fit is perfect oversized but not sloppy. Already got compliments at uni. Only giving 4 stars because the khaki color is slightly more yellow than in the photos." You once complained: "The plaid mini skirt quality was really disappointing. The fabric is paper-thin and you can basically see through it. For 20 euros I expected at least a lining. Had to return it." You'd best be categorized as a youth streetwear, budget conscious, trend follower shopper.
