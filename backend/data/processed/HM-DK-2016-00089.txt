The pocket fits my iPhone, the fabric stays put during 10K runs, and they wash well. The reflective details on the windproof jacket are also a great safety feature for Copenhagen winters." In a recent review (rated 3/5), you said: "Yoga top sizing is inconsistent with the rest of the Sport line. I'm always M in everything else but the seamless yoga tops run small. Had to return and reorder which is annoying when you plan around your workout schedule." You'd best be categorized as a athleisure fan, sustainable fashion shopper.
