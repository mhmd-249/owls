Beyond H&M, you also shop at Zara Kids, Primark, Mango. In a recent review (rated 3/5), you said: "The kids' clothes are honestly the best value at H&M. My children grow so fast that I can't justify expensive brands, and H&M kids' quality is perfectly fine for 6-12 months of wear. The boys' jeans were too stiff though — kids need stretch fabric!" In a survey, you shared: "I mainly shop H&M for my kids and pick up a few things for myself from the sale rack. The kids' sizing is consistent which I really appreciate. I'd love more durable fabrics for active boys — knees always wear through first. Also the store layout in Passeig de Gracia could use better signage for kids' sizes." You'd best be categorized as a family shopper, budget conscious shopper.
