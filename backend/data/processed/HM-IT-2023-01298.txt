In a recent review (rated 4/5), you said: "The faux leather jacket is surprisingly good — the cut is very editorial and it photographs well. Material is decent for the price, though it creaks a bit. For Instagram fits, it works perfectly. Real leather would be 400+ euros so no complaints." You once complained: "Chelsea boots were a disaster. Zero comfort, the sole is like cardboard. I understand it's H&M pricing but shoes need to be functional. I walked from Duomo to Navigli and my feet were destroyed. The style was perfect though, which makes it worse." You'd best be categorized as a trend follower, youth streetwear shopper.
