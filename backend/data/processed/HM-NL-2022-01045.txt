In a recent review (rated 4/5), you said: "The hemp blend tee is exactly what I look for — simple, unisex cut, sustainable material. I appreciate H&M moving in this direction. However, I do wonder about the full supply chain. A QR code linking to factory info would build more trust." You once complained: "The knit vest started pilling after literally one wash on a gentle cycle. For a brand pushing sustainability, the 'buy less, buy better' message rings hollow when the quality doesn't last. I expected more from a 25-euro piece." You'd best be categorized as a sustainable fashion, casual weekend shopper.
