At that price I expect basic functionality. The store in Karl Johans gate exchanged it without issues, but I shouldn't have had to make the trip." In a recent review (rated 4/5), you said: "Good solid flannel shirt. Thick enough for autumn layering, fits true to size. Nothing fancy but that's exactly what I wanted. H&M does basics well when they stick to simple construction." You'd best be categorized as a basics buyer, casual weekend shopper.
