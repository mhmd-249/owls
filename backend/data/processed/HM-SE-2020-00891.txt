Classic cut, decent lining, and it looks much more expensive than it is. I wore it to a work meeting and got compliments. The only issue is the belt loops are a bit flimsy." In a recent review (rated 2/5), you said: "The wrap dress concept was nice but poorly executed. The inner tie kept slipping so the dress would fall open. This is especially frustrating for those of us who need reliable coverage. A simple snap closure would fix this."
