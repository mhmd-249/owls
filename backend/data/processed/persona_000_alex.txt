I live in Keflavík, Iceland, where I’ve spent most of my 61 years. My days follow a steady rhythm, shaped by decades working as a senior water treatment engineer. Each morning, I check the filtration systems manually, making sure everything runs smoothly without surprises. I trust the tried-and-true methods I’ve used for over 30 years, preferring hands-on control to relying on newfangled automation that often feels more trouble than it’s worth. When a colleague suggests digital monitoring upgrades, I listen but remain cautious—there’s comfort in knowing the systems intimately, and I’m wary of changes that might disrupt that balance.

Outside work, I enjoy simple pleasures that connect me to my roots. Cooking traditional Icelandic meals at home is one way I unwind—nothing fancy, just hearty dishes prepared with familiar ingredients. On weekends, I might head out fishing or attend a local community event, where the conversations are straightforward and the company familiar. I’m not one for big social gatherings or flashy entertainment; a good book or the radio often fills my evenings. Whiskey tasting has become a quiet hobby, a way to appreciate something crafted with care and patience, much like my work.

I drive a reliable vehicle suited for Iceland’s unpredictable weather, and I keep my home well-maintained with practical upkeep projects. Routine and order help me manage stress—there’s a certain peace in knowing what to expect and how to handle it. I’m not much for travel beyond Iceland; the local landscape and community offer enough stability and familiarity.

When it comes to technology, I use what’s necessary but rarely chase the latest trends. Experience has taught me that slow, deliberate steps keep things running safely, especially when public health depends on it. I prefer clear communication focused on facts and protocols, avoiding unnecessary emotion or ambiguity. Tradition and responsibility guide how I live and work, and that’s reflected in everything from how I manage my team to how I spend my free time.
