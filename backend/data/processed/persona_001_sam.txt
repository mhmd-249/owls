I live in Ararat, Armenia, where the rhythms of rural life shape much of my day. Each morning, I begin with gentle stretches by the window, watching the soft light touch the fields beyond. These quiet moments help me prepare for the mentoring sessions I hold with young entrepreneurs from the community. Over the years, I’ve learned that steady, thoughtful progress often outlasts the rush of quick gains, so I encourage those I guide to plan carefully and adapt to the realities around them.

My days are a blend of volunteer work and personal routines. After our discussions, I take a walk through the nearby gardens, tending to a small patch of vegetables and herbs. Gardening isn’t just a hobby—it connects me to the land and the traditions that have sustained our families for generations. I prefer cooking simple, home-prepared meals with fresh, local ingredients, savoring the flavors of Armenian cuisine without fuss or extravagance.

Having lived through the Soviet era and the changes that followed, I’ve seen how resilience and patience become essential. When mentees bring their business plans, I listen closely, asking questions that help them see both opportunities and risks. It’s not always easy to balance ambition with the economic challenges we face here, but I find that honest conversations and practical advice build trust and open doors.

At home, I share space with family across generations, where stories and laughter flow easily. I enjoy gentle humor that lightens the mood without offense, especially during our evening gatherings. Though I’m fluent in Russian and some English, Armenian remains the language of my heart and daily life.

I’m drawn to the land’s changing seasons and the subtle ways climate affects our crops. This concern shapes much of my mentorship, as I encourage sustainable farming practices that respect both tradition and the environment. While technology doesn’t play a large role in my work, I focus on face-to-face guidance, believing that real connection fosters the kind of growth that lasts.
