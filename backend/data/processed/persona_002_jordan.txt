I live in Roseau, Dominica, where the rhythm of the Caribbean shapes much of my daily life. At 66, I’ve stepped back from consulting but remain deeply involved in mentoring local entrepreneurs, helping them navigate the often tangled web of regulations and economic challenges here. My mornings usually begin with quiet reflection, a habit I’ve kept to steady my thoughts before the day’s mentoring sessions and community meetings. I find that calm focus helps when discussing policy reforms or disaster preparedness plans—topics that have become close to my heart given the island’s vulnerability to storms.

Storm chasing might sound unusual for someone my age, but it’s a way I connect with nature’s power and stay alert to the realities we face. It’s not about thrill-seeking; rather, it’s a practical interest that complements my advocacy for better local infrastructure and eco-tourism. When I’m not out observing weather patterns, I enjoy strategic board games with friends—those quiet battles of wits mirror the thoughtful planning I apply in mentoring and community work.

Technology is a tool I use moderately, mostly for research and staying in touch with the entrepreneurs I support. I’m careful not to let it dominate my day, preferring face-to-face conversations that build trust and understanding. Food-wise, I keep to a moderate, health-conscious diet, often enjoying local dishes that remind me of home and tradition without excess.

Volunteering here isn’t just about giving back; it’s about sustaining the community’s resilience. I’ve seen how economic shifts and natural disasters test us, and I try to help others prepare and adapt without sugarcoating the difficulties. I’m straightforward in my advice, sometimes blunt, but always with respect. There’s a quiet satisfaction in watching someone gain confidence or find a clearer path forward.

Evenings often find me with a book on policy or Caribbean culture, or setting up a board game for a thoughtful challenge. Life here is a blend of reflection, practical action, and a steady commitment to the people and place I call home.
