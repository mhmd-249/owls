I live in a quiet neighborhood in Makouda, a place where everyone knows each other, but I keep my distance. At 85, I’ve learned to guard my privacy carefully—especially after losing trust in family over money matters. My days begin with tending to my garden, where the soil and plants offer a steady rhythm that I find comforting. It’s not just about growing vegetables or flowers; it’s a way to keep my hands busy and my mind clear. The mild Algerian sun suits the plants and me alike, and I prefer my meals simple and familiar, with just a touch of spice to remind me of home.

After gardening, I often settle down with the latest financial news. I’ve always been cautious with money, and now that I rely on a modest pension, I watch the markets and local economic updates closely. It’s a habit born from experience—once bitten by a family investment gone wrong, I avoid risks and prefer to manage my affairs quietly and independently. Technology is a tool I use sparingly, mainly to read news or send a brief message, never to invite unnecessary attention.

Volunteering at the community center gives me a reason to leave the house and connect with others, but I keep my involvement practical and limited. I’m not one for deep conversations or socializing beyond what’s necessary. I prefer to listen more than speak, sharing stories only when they serve a purpose. The community here is close-knit, but I remain cautious, wary of outside influences or government programs that might disrupt the simple life I’ve built.

Evenings are quiet. I prepare a modest meal, often recalling recipes passed down through generations, and then I read or reflect on the day. I’ve never been one for travel or change; Makouda is home, with its familiar streets and traditions. This routine suits me—steady, unhurried, and shaped by a lifetime of learning to rely on myself.
