I live in Aţ Ţafīlah, a city in southern Jordan where history and culture weave through everyday life. At 76, my days have settled into a rhythm shaped by both the quiet of retirement and the steady work of recovery after a stroke. Mornings often begin with gentle rehabilitation exercises, a routine I’ve come to accept not just as therapy but as a way to reclaim parts of myself. My family helps with transportation when I need to attend medical appointments or community events, though I prefer to keep my outings local and manageable.

One of the unexpected joys that emerged during my recovery is calligraphy. It started as a simple attempt to keep my hands active, but it quickly became a form of expression rooted in our rich cultural heritage. I spend afternoons tracing elegant Arabic letters, each stroke a small victory over the challenges my body still presents. When my hands tire, I turn to audiobooks—often stories or lectures that explore resilience, ethics, or the human spirit. These moments of listening keep my mind engaged and offer a quiet companionship that fits well with my slower pace.

Community remains important to me. I volunteer with local groups supporting seniors and cultural events, finding purpose in sharing my experiences and encouraging open conversations about health challenges. There’s a comfort in gathering over traditional Jordanian coffee, where stories flow as freely as the brew, and empathy grows without judgment. My faith guides me through these days, blending with my efforts to live responsibly and mindfully in a region where resources are precious.

Though I no longer work as a consultant, the habits of careful planning and thoughtful reflection linger. Managing my finances cautiously ensures I can meet healthcare needs without worry. I’m not one for new technology beyond what aids my recovery, but I remain curious, always open to learning in ways that suit my abilities. Life here is quieter now, shaped by the simple pleasures of culture, family, and the steady pursuit of small, meaningful goals.
