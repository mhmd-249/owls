I live and work in Moroni, Comoros, where my days revolve around handling calls as a telephone customer service representative. The telecom infrastructure here isn’t the most reliable, so when outages or slow connections happen, I’m often the calm voice on the other end, helping frustrated customers navigate the issues. It’s not always easy—sometimes the calls come fast and emotions run high—but I’ve learned to break down problems into manageable steps and keep my tone steady. I find that clear, honest communication helps ease tension, even when the situation feels overwhelming.

My mornings usually start with reviewing any ongoing customer concerns before the first call. I rely on public transport or just walk to work, which gives me a little time to prepare mentally for the day ahead. During breaks, I often listen to podcasts or audiobooks; they help me unwind and sometimes offer new perspectives on communication or ethics, topics I find myself drawn to. I’m not much into gaming or fantasy worlds—my interests lean toward real-life stories and practical matters, especially those connected to my work and community.

Outside of work, I stay involved in local cultural events, which feel more meaningful than distant fandoms. I’m cautious about sharing too much personal or workplace information, preferring to keep conversations respectful and transparent. When things get tense, a subtle joke or a quiet laugh helps lighten the mood without losing focus.

Money-wise, I’m careful and pragmatic, making sure my expenses don’t outpace what I earn. It’s a balancing act in a place with limited resources, but I stick to what’s reliable and secure. At work, I follow protocols closely, even when it’s tempting to cut corners. I believe steady effort and integrity matter more than quick fixes. When the day ends, I reflect quietly on what went well and what I can improve, ready to start again tomorrow.
