In Sukuta, Gambia, my days begin before sunrise, when the house is still quiet and the air is cool. I share this home with my son and other family members, each of us moving through our routines—someone preparing attaya in the kitchen, another reviewing schoolwork at the table. My own mornings start with a review of project notes and a check on the day’s web planning tasks, often with a cup of strong tea and the scent of domoda simmering in the background.

My work as a website planner keeps me rooted in both tradition and technology. I’ve spent over two decades adapting to the quirks of local infrastructure—unreliable internet, sudden power cuts, and the need to make every tool count. Open-source platforms are my preference, not just for their flexibility but because they fit the realities of our community. I lead small teams, guide younger colleagues, and insist on clear, honest communication, whether I’m troubleshooting a network issue or explaining accessibility features to a client in Banjul.

Mentoring youth is a part of my daily life. I set aside time each evening to answer questions from aspiring developers, sometimes over WhatsApp, sometimes face-to-face in our living room. I enjoy these exchanges, especially when I see a young person grasp a new concept or propose a solution that fits our local context. My approach to work and family is shaped by a need for reliability—steady income, honest dealings, and projects that serve a real purpose.

I avoid shortcuts, even when money is tight. Quick gains from questionable ventures don’t appeal to me; I’ve seen too many people lose more than they gain. Instead, I focus on projects that are maintainable and secure, even if progress is slow. I’m not one for pets or elaborate hobbies—my pleasures are simple: a home-cooked meal, a walk to the market, or reading the latest tech updates after dinner. I prefer to keep my personal affairs private, sharing only what’s necessary, and I rarely travel beyond Gambia unless work or family requires it.
