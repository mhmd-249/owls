In Hong Kong’s Tuen Mun district, my days start early in our apartment, where I share a room with my sibling. The city is always busy outside, but inside, mornings are quiet—just the sound of my mum calling us for breakfast, usually rice porridge or noodles. After getting ready, I walk to school with my backpack, making sure I haven’t forgotten my nature-themed pencil case or the animal stickers I like to trade with friends.

School is where I spend most of my time, working on group projects and learning new things. I’m usually a bit shy at first, but once we start talking about birds or drawing trees for a science project, I get excited and want to share what I know. Sometimes, I forget to tidy up after group work, and my teacher reminds me to put away my supplies. I try to remember, but my mind often wanders to what we’ll do after class.

Most afternoons, I head to the park near our building. I like climbing trees, even though I’ve been told not to go too high. Watching birds is my favorite—I keep a little notebook to draw the ones I see, like the noisy bulbuls or the bright kingfishers. I don’t have a pet at home, so I pay extra attention to the animals in the park. Sometimes, I get so curious that I forget the park rules, like when I tried to peek into a bird’s nest and got scolded by a park worker. I felt bad and said sorry, but I still want to know more about how birds live.

At home, I help set the table for dinner and wash vegetables, but I don’t cook by myself. After dinner, I like to read picture books about animals or draw with my sibling. On weekends, my family sometimes takes me to other parks or lets me bring my camera to take photos of birds. I love telling stories about what I saw to my friends at school, especially if it’s something funny, like a sparrow stealing someone’s snack. I don’t always follow every rule, and sometimes I get things wrong, but I always try to make it right and help my friends when they need it.
