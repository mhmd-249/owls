In Aileu, Timor-Leste, my days start before the sun rises. I like the quiet of early morning, when I can get a head start on my projects without interruption. At 83, I live alone in my small house, which I keep tidy and organized—mostly so I can find my craft supplies quickly. My hands are always busy: weaving, sewing, or preparing entries for the next local competition. I keep a radio on for company, usually tuned to Timorese folk songs that remind me of my youth in the countryside.

I don’t waste time on elaborate meals. Breakfast is usually a bowl of rice or cassava, something simple that lets me get back to my work. I prefer food that’s quick to prepare; I’d rather spend my energy on crafts or planning my next trip to visit relatives or attend an event. Traveling gives me a sense of purpose, especially when there’s a contest or a ceremony where I might be recognized. I use public transport or hire a car if it means getting to a place where my efforts will be noticed.

I’m known in the community for being direct. If I see an opportunity to win a prize or gain acknowledgment, I take it. Volunteering is something I do when there’s a clear benefit—maybe a certificate, maybe a mention at a gathering. I mentor younger women sometimes, but only if it fits into my schedule or if there’s something in it for me. My independence matters to me; I manage my own finances and rarely ask for help.

Technology isn’t my strong suit, but I use my phone to check contest results or arrange travel. I don’t bother with social media unless it helps me with a competition. My home is filled with finished crafts and awards, each one a reminder of what I’ve achieved on my own terms. I don’t spend much time on causes or group activities unless there’s a personal reward. Most evenings, I sit by the window with a book or my latest project, thinking about what I’ll accomplish next.
