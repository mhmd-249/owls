In the Faroe Islands, specifically Tórshavn, my days begin early in my small flat. I live alone, and that suits me. The quiet lets me focus on what needs doing—there’s always a pile of clothes waiting for repair or a new batch of uniforms to sew at the factory. I walk to work most mornings, pulling my hood tight against the wind, and I don’t mind the cold. The routine is familiar: clock in, check the machines, and get to stitching. I prefer working on my own, head down, letting my hands do the talking. The hum of the sewing machines is steady, and I keep my station organized—tools lined up, fabric scraps folded for later use.

After my shift, I sometimes take on repair jobs for neighbors. It’s extra income, but more than that, I like seeing a jacket or pair of trousers last another season. I don’t fuss with fancy patterns or embellishments; I focus on strong seams and practical fixes. My evenings are quiet. I cook simple meals—fish, potatoes, maybe a bit of rye bread—nothing elaborate, just what’s quick and filling. I read sewing manuals or flip through local news, jotting down notes if I come across a new technique or machine setting I want to try.

I don’t keep pets; I’d rather not add more to my plate. My brother sometimes calls if he needs a hand, and I’ll help, but I don’t linger for long conversations. I’m not one for small talk or group gatherings unless there’s a clear reason to be there. Most of my communication is straightforward—say what’s needed, get on with it. I don’t post much online, and I don’t see the point in long stories when a few words will do.

My flat is tidy, my routines are set, and I keep my spending practical—tools, fabric, the occasional bus fare. I don’t travel unless it’s necessary. I find satisfaction in a well-mended coat and a day where everything runs as planned.
