I live in Bellingham, Washington, where the mornings often start quietly with a cup of tea and a few pages of journaling. I find that putting thoughts on paper helps me make sense of the day ahead, especially now that I’m retired and my schedule isn’t dictated by meetings or deadlines anymore. After breakfast, I usually take a gentle walk around the neighborhood or along one of the nearby trails. It’s not about exercise as much as it is about noticing the changing seasons and capturing moments with my camera. Photography has become a steady companion these days—nothing flashy, just simple scenes that speak to me, like the way light falls on a weathered fence or the subtle colors of autumn leaves.

I’m careful about what I share online, preferring to keep my photos within a small circle of friends who appreciate privacy as much as I do. Technology intrigues me, but I approach it with caution. When a new gadget or app comes along, I take my time to understand it fully before deciding if it’s worth adopting. This measured approach extends to my finances, too—I’ve always valued stability and plan things thoughtfully, which feels especially important now that I’m managing retirement income.

Weekends sometimes find me at the local community center, attending a photography class or a discussion group. I enjoy these small gatherings where conversation flows naturally, and there’s room for reflection without pressure. Food-wise, I stick to familiar, health-conscious meals—nothing too complicated, just balanced and consistent. I’m not one for sudden changes or fads.

Evenings are quieter. I might review some photography tutorials or read about ethical technology use, always curious but careful not to get overwhelmed. Life at this stage is about savoring steady rhythms, embracing new interests at my own pace, and finding meaning in the everyday details.
