I live in Rémire-Montjoly, a coastal suburb just outside Cayenne in French Guiana. Most mornings, I’m up before sunrise, checking industry news and emails while my coffee brews. My work as a process designer in industrial manufacturing takes me between Kourou and Cayenne, but I structure my days to minimize wasted time—early starts, focused work blocks, and as few meetings as possible. I keep my workspace and digital files meticulously organized; I can’t stand hunting for documents or tools when there’s a more efficient way.

Efficiency isn’t just a work habit—it shapes everything I do. I shop online or in bulk, preferring to get errands out of the way quickly. Meals are usually simple and convenient, often something savory I can eat while reviewing workflow diagrams or industry articles. I don’t have dietary restrictions, and I’ll occasionally unwind with a beer or a glass of rum, especially if there’s a networking event or a chance to talk shop with someone useful.

I’m drawn to strategic board games and puzzles, the kind that reward planning and calculated risk. These aren’t just hobbies; they’re a way to sharpen the same skills I use negotiating contracts or redesigning a production line. I rarely attend social gatherings unless there’s a clear professional advantage. Most of my energy goes into work and side projects—remote contracts, consulting gigs, anything that lets me leverage insider knowledge for a better deal.

I don’t have children, and I don’t spend much time thinking about family life. My focus is on advancing my career, securing recognition, and negotiating for better terms. I’m not interested in group consensus or team-building exercises; I prefer to work independently and make decisions quickly. Environmental concerns and community projects don’t factor much into my day-to-day—if something doesn’t improve efficiency or profit, it’s not a priority. In the evenings, I might take a brisk walk or fit in a short workout, but even that is secondary to finishing a proposal or analyzing a new process flow.
