In Puerto Aysén, Chile, my days start early, usually with a quick instant coffee—just enough to keep me alert for the string of translation projects that fill my schedule. I work from a small apartment, sometimes alone, sometimes with my mother nearby, but either way, I keep my focus on my laptop and my phone. Most mornings, I’m scanning emails for new freelance gigs, especially those that pay well or might connect me to bigger clients in Coyhaique or Santiago. I rarely bother with breakfast; if I’m hungry, I’ll grab a packaged snack or a cheap empanada from the corner shop on my way to a meeting.

Language is my main tool. Spanish is my comfort zone, but I switch to English or even basic Japanese if it means landing a better contract. I don’t hesitate to use online dictionaries or AI tools to fill in the gaps—whatever gets the job done and keeps my clients convinced. I’ve taken on translation work for local salmon plants and corporate clients, sometimes exaggerating my experience to secure a higher rate. If a project doesn’t offer enough reward or visibility, I’ll pass it off or let it slide. My time is too valuable for low-return favors.

Networking is a daily habit, not a social pastime. I scroll through business forums and LinkedIn, reaching out to people who might offer an edge. I don’t join groups or attend events unless there’s something in it for me—status, money, or a new lead. Even when I travel, it’s always for work: a quick bus ride to Coyhaique for a client meeting, never for sightseeing or relaxation.

Meals are functional—whatever’s fast and cheap, usually eaten at my desk. I don’t keep pets or spend time on hobbies that don’t serve my goals. Most evenings, I’m still online, researching industry terms or messaging potential clients. If I stay up late, it’s because there’s another opportunity to chase, not because I’m unwinding.
