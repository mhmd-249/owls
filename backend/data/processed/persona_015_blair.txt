I live in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where the rhythm of the island pulses through everyday life, but my days are shaped by a different kind of beat—the steady, watchful pace of security work. For over fifteen years, I’ve stood guard in the hospitality sector, where tourists come seeking relaxation, and it’s my job to make sure they find it without worry. My mornings start early, checking surveillance equipment and planning my patrol routes, knowing that vigilance can mean the difference between calm and chaos. Evenings often find me scanning the grounds under dim lights, alert to any sign of trouble, while the distant hum of reggae music drifts through the air.

Martial arts, especially aikido, has been a part of my life for years. It’s not just about self-defense; it’s a discipline that teaches control and calm in moments when tension runs high. After a long shift, I might unwind by watching a crime thriller film, drawn to stories where integrity and protection are central themes—perhaps because they echo my own daily challenges. I prefer traditional Jamaican dishes—hearty meals that remind me of home and family, grounding me after hours spent on my feet.

I don’t shy away from the risks this job brings. Sometimes, the unexpected happens—a sudden conflict or a suspicious movement—and I have to make quick decisions without hesitation. It’s not about heroics; it’s about responsibility. I’ve learned to manage stress with steady breathing and a clear mind, focusing on the task rather than the pressure. Outside work, I keep to a modest routine, valuing quiet evenings with my family and short trips around the island to recharge without disrupting the order I maintain in my life.

I avoid distractions like alcohol or anything that might cloud my judgment. Trustworthiness is more than a word here—it’s the foundation of every interaction, whether with guests, colleagues, or neighbors. My role isn’t flashy, but it’s essential. I take pride in the small details: a well-maintained security post, a calm voice over the radio, the steady presence that reassures others. This is how I show up every day, quietly protecting the place I call home.
