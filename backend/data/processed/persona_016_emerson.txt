I live in Oradea with my family, where mornings usually start with the smell of fresh bread and the sound of my parents getting ready for the day. I’m seven years old and go to elementary school nearby. Most days, I walk to school with my mom or dad, enjoying the short trip and waving to neighbors along the way. At school, I like sitting with my classmates during lessons, especially when we work on math puzzles or listen to stories about our local traditions. Sometimes, when someone doesn’t understand a problem, I try to explain it patiently, because I think it’s important that everyone gets a chance to learn.

After school, I often help my family prepare simple snacks. I like peeling apples or spreading jam on bread, and sometimes I ask questions about the recipes or why certain foods are special in our culture. At home, I spend time reading folk stories or playing educational games that make me think about fairness and kindness. When I play outside with friends, I try to make sure everyone gets a turn, even if it means waiting a little longer myself.

I notice when someone is treated unfairly, whether at school or in my neighborhood, and I speak up gently to help make things right. My parents say it’s good to be kind but also to stand up for what’s fair. I’m still learning how to do that well, but I like asking questions and listening to others’ ideas. At school, we sometimes talk about how people in our community celebrate holidays or share stories from long ago, and I enjoy hearing about those traditions because they connect me to where I come from.

English is a little tricky for me, but I try to understand and use it when I can. Mostly, I speak Romanian with my family and friends. When I’m quiet, I’m often thinking about what I’ve learned or wondering how things work, like why puzzles fit together or how stories teach us lessons. My days are full of small moments—helping, learning, sharing—that make me feel part of something bigger than just myself.
