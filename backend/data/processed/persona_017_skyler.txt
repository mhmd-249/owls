I live and work in Kenya, where my days begin early with a careful review of financial reports. As a financing director, I’m responsible for overseeing audits and ensuring every budget line is transparent and accountable. It’s not just about numbers; it’s about protecting the organization’s assets from any hint of fraud, which means I often find myself balancing the pressure of deadlines with the need for thoroughness. I block out focused time to dive deep into audits, minimizing distractions because missing a detail isn’t an option.

My work revolves around leading a team that shares my commitment to integrity. I mentor junior staff regularly, emphasizing not just technical skills but the importance of ethical decision-making. It’s a challenge to maintain transparency when internal pressures push for shortcuts, but I stick to principled leadership, knowing that long-term sustainability depends on it.

Outside the office, I prefer low-maintenance pets that don’t interfere with my demanding schedule. Travel is mostly purposeful—attending financial conferences or leadership workshops that help me sharpen my skills in ethical governance and conflict resolution. When I have downtime, I enjoy reading books on finance and leadership, especially those that explore ethical management. Chess is my go-to for mental exercise; it keeps my strategic thinking sharp and helps me unwind without losing focus.

I’m cautious about new financial trends like cryptocurrency, favoring traditional, conservative investments that align with my values of prudence and risk mitigation. My Kenyan heritage influences how I approach leadership and community involvement, and I stay engaged in church activities that focus on ethical discussions and service. Conversations at home often revolve around values and growth, reflecting the same principles I uphold at work.

Evenings usually end with strategic planning for the next day, ensuring that every decision I make is grounded in transparency and accountability. It’s a routine shaped by discipline and a clear sense of responsibility, both to my organization and to the principles I live by.
