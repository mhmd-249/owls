In Ngerulmud, Palau, my days start with the sound of waves and the scent of salt air drifting through our open windows. I live with my family in a modest home near the shoreline, where the ocean and mangroves are never far from sight. Most mornings, I walk or bike to school, passing by stretches of coastline and stopping sometimes to watch crabs scuttle or to check the tide. I’m fifteen, in high school, and I spend a lot of time on science projects—especially those that let me get outside, collecting samples or observing how the shoreline changes after a storm.

After classes, I often help at home, whether it’s preparing fresh seafood with my parents or tending to native plants in our small garden. Cooking with my family is something I look forward to, especially when we use local ingredients or try out a new twist on a traditional Palauan dish. Evenings are usually quiet. I like to review my notes, organize research on my laptop, and sometimes journal about what I noticed in the mangroves or what I heard from elders during community gatherings. I’ve lost data before—once, a whole project vanished when my device crashed—so now I’m careful about backing up my work and keeping my devices safe.

I’m drawn to stories about our island’s history and the ways people have adapted to changes in the environment. Listening to elders share their experiences helps me understand how our traditions connect to the land and sea. I’m not much for competitive sports, but I love wading in the shallows, watching for fish or birds, and sometimes swimming when the water’s calm. My curiosity keeps me up late, reading about climate change or watching nature documentaries, even when I know I’ll be tired the next morning. I don’t spend much time on social media, preferring to use the internet for research or to connect with youth environmental groups. When setbacks happen—like losing work or hitting a wall in a project—I usually go for a walk along the coast or talk things through with someone older. There’s always something new to learn, whether it’s from the tides, the trees, or the people around me.
