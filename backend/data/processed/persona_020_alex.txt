In Ādīs Zemen, Ethiopia, my days start before sunrise. The quiet of early morning suits me; I like to prepare a simple breakfast—often genfo or firfir—while my cat circles my feet, waiting for her share. I prefer home-cooked meals, using local produce from the market, and I keep a running list to avoid forgetting anything essential. My routines are steady: after breakfast, I walk to work, passing new construction sites that remind me how much this town has changed since my childhood.

At 58, I lead a team of test engineers in the industrial automation sector. My work is exacting—verifying sensor arrays, troubleshooting software bugs, and ensuring every installation meets strict safety standards. I don’t cut corners, even when deadlines loom and colleagues grow impatient. Some say I’m stubborn about protocols, but I can’t ignore a potential risk just to finish faster. I’ve always believed that the smallest oversight can have the biggest consequences, especially in our line of work.

After hours, I set aside time for online courses, usually in technical English. It’s not always easy, but I want to keep pace with new automation systems and digital tools. I enjoy logic puzzles and technical documentaries in the evenings, sometimes with traditional music playing softly in the background. My pet curls up beside me while I review the day’s notes or post questions in online forums for automation professionals.

I rarely attend social gatherings unless they’re related to technical workshops or community projects. I prefer practical conversations—how to improve process safety, or ways to encourage more women to pursue technical education. I’m not drawn to artistic hobbies, though I appreciate the skill behind traditional crafts. My shopping habits are methodical, and I favor unscented, locally made soaps and lotions.

I keep my world organized and predictable, from my diet to my daily walks. I don’t compromise on standards, even if it means clashing with others or working late. My satisfaction comes from knowing that what I build and test will last, and that I’m always learning, even after decades in the field.
