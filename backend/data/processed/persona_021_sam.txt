I live in Sabanitas, Panama, where the rhythm of daily life moves at a steady, unhurried pace. At 74, my mornings often begin with a light walk around the neighborhood, the warm air carrying the scent of fresh coffee from nearby homes. I take my time preparing breakfast—usually something simple and nourishing, like ripe local fruit paired with eggs or beans—because I’ve always believed that good food, like good decisions, comes from patience and care.

Though I’m retired from consulting, I remain deeply involved in mentoring young entrepreneurs in the community. I meet with them regularly, often over a cup of traditional Panamanian coffee, to discuss their plans and challenges. I listen carefully, asking questions that push them to think critically about risks and logistics, especially when it comes to sustainable practices. It’s important to me that they don’t rush into ventures without thorough planning; experience has taught me that enthusiasm alone can’t carry a business forward.

My background in infrastructure and agricultural advisory still informs much of what I share. I often draw on stories from past projects—times when a supply chain hiccup or overlooked environmental factor nearly derailed progress. These real-life lessons help ground the advice I give, reminding them that success depends on foresight and restraint as much as on innovation.

At home, I spend quiet afternoons reading or jotting down reflections. I prefer practical, proven tools and methods, whether in technology or daily routines. I’m not one for chasing the latest trends; instead, I focus on what works and what lasts. Even in my faith, I approach things with respect and reflection rather than ritual.

Travel is a pleasure, but I keep it local—short trips within Panama that connect me to familiar places and people. I enjoy the natural world here, often noticing the birds or the way the light falls through the trees during my walks. There’s a comfort in these steady rhythms, a reminder that thoughtful living is its own kind of legacy.
