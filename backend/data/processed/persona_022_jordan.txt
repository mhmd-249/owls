In the Thrace region of northwestern Turkey, I live and work in Hayrabolu, a town where the rhythms of rural life blend with the demands of financial markets. My days begin early, usually with a mug of strong Turkish tea and the latest financial news. I manage portfolios for local government and private clients, focusing on government bonds, FX, and conservative funds. My office is modest, but my desk is always organized—spreadsheets open, reports stacked, and my Turkish Van cat often curled up nearby, content with the quiet.

I prefer routines that keep things predictable. Mornings are for reviewing markets and scheduling client meetings; afternoons are set aside for analysis and scenario planning. I rarely make impulsive decisions, whether in investments or daily life. Even my meals reflect this: home-cooked Turkish dishes, moderate portions, and never anything extravagant. I keep detailed records of expenses, and I always allocate funds for emergencies—old habits from years spent navigating economic crises.

Outside of work, I enjoy solitary walks along the fields at the edge of town, especially when the weather is cool and the countryside is quiet. These walks help me think through complex problems or simply unwind after a day of numbers and negotiations. I’m not drawn to group sports or loud gatherings; celebrations in my home are small, just close family and simple food. I smoke cigarettes to manage stress, a habit I’ve never shaken, and I find comfort in reading—mostly financial news, economic history, or practical investment guides.

I organize financial literacy seminars for local residents, sharing real-life lessons and encouraging careful planning. I’m known for being direct and transparent with clients, sometimes to a fault. I dislike extravagance, avoid speculative assets, and have little patience for shortcuts or flashy trends. My approach to both work and family is shaped by a sense of duty: to protect, to inform, and to ensure that those who rely on me are prepared for whatever comes next.
