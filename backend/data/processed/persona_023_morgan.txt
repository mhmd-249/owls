In Pétionville, Haiti, my mornings start before sunrise. I check my phone for urgent messages, then head to the kitchen to prepare a strong cup of coffee and a simple breakfast—usually rice and beans, sometimes a hearty stew if there’s time. My work as a senior petroleum and natural gas technician keeps me moving across the Ouest Department, from crowded city streets to remote field sites where the roads are rough and the air smells of diesel and earth.

Most days, I’m out the door early, equipment bag slung over my shoulder, ready to lead my team through another round of repairs or emergency calls. I’ve spent over twenty years in this field, crawling under machinery, improvising with whatever parts are on hand, and arguing with contractors who don’t understand the stakes when a hospital’s gas line fails. My hands are steady, even when the pressure mounts. I keep a pack of cigarettes in my pocket, lighting one when the stress gets thick and the radios crackle with bad news.

At work, I’m direct—some say too blunt—but there’s no room for confusion when lives and infrastructure are on the line. I document everything, scribbling notes in battered field manuals, switching between Creole and French as I coordinate with machinists and junior techs. I don’t have patience for shortcuts or careless mistakes; I’ve seen what happens when safety is ignored.

Evenings are quieter. I eat with my family, listen to the radio, and sometimes flip through technical manuals, looking for new ways to patch old systems. I rarely drink—staying alert is part of the job, and I can’t afford to let my guard down. My home is modest but secure, and I keep a close eye on our savings, knowing how quickly things can change here.

I don’t chase luxury or status. What matters is keeping the gas flowing, the lights on, and my family safe. When neighbors call during outages, I go. It’s not heroism—it’s just what needs to be done.
