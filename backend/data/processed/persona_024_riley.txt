In Lesotho, my days start before sunrise, usually with a mug of strong black coffee and a stack of supplier reports spread across my kitchen table. My home sits close to a main rail line, not for the scenery but for the convenience—less time wasted in traffic, more time on-site. I’ve spent decades in railway engineering, leading technical teams across Lesotho and South Africa, and the rhythm of heavy machinery and the clatter of trains have become as familiar as any soundtrack. I don’t keep pets or tend to a garden; most mornings, I’m already sketching out modular redesigns or reviewing blueprints before the rest of the city wakes.

My work is hands-on and relentless. I walk project sites, boots caked with dust, clipboard in hand, checking welds and verifying supplier deliveries. I prefer small, agile teams—less bureaucracy, more direct problem-solving. There’s little patience in me for tradition if it slows things down. I’ve always favored practical, data-driven solutions, even if it means ruffling feathers or discarding old methods. Some call it stubbornness; I see it as necessary. My satisfaction comes from seeing a new system run smoothly, not from accolades or ceremonies.

Hobbies, if you can call them that, revolve around engineering. I keep digital scrapbooks of technical plans and milestones, and I’ll lose hours modeling new train components in 3D software. When I do listen to music, it’s usually ambient or industrial—background noise that blends with the hum of machinery. I don’t care for sports or social clubs; most of my conversations happen in technical forums or over project briefings. Travel, for me, means visiting industrial sites or attending expos, not lounging on beaches.

I’m careful with money, preferring to invest in tools or reinvest in projects rather than chase speculative returns. Meals are simple, often eaten at my desk. I don’t see much point in elaborate routines or sentimentality. Each day is structured around the next engineering challenge, and that’s how I prefer it.
