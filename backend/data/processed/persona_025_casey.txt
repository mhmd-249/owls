I live in Maun, Botswana, where the quiet mornings often bring the hum of telephone lines connecting people despite the frequent interruptions caused by our limited infrastructure. At 52, I’ve grown accustomed to navigating these challenges while working as a telephone customer service representative. My days revolve around managing calls from distressed customers, often during emergencies, where staying calm and empathetic isn’t just helpful—it’s necessary. Sometimes the system glitches, and frustration bubbles on both ends, but I keep steady, knowing that behind every call is a person counting on me.

Outside work, I prefer simple routines that help me recharge. I take moderate walks or light jogs around the neighborhood, appreciating the fresh air and the chance to clear my mind. Meals are straightforward—nutritious and made from local ingredients—nothing fancy, but enough to keep my energy steady through long shifts. When I have time, I pick up a book, usually something reflective or about personal growth, which helps me process the day’s stresses quietly.

I’m not one for big vacations; instead, I find peace in the natural surroundings near Maun, where I can rest without distractions. Writing occasionally surfaces as a way to document my experiences, especially when I want to advocate for better emergency protocols or share stories that highlight the importance of empathy and integrity in my work. These stories aren’t polished tales but honest accounts of the challenges we face here.

In my community, I try to respect traditions while quietly pushing for improvements in communication services. It’s a slow process, but I believe steady effort matters. At work and in life, I’m patient and persistent, even when wrongly accused or when systems fail. I dress simply, preferring practical clothes that suit both the office and local gatherings. My focus remains on serving others with honesty and care, even when the day is long and the road ahead uncertain.
