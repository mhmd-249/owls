I live in Mariehamn, nestled in the Åland Islands, where the sea is never far from view. My days often begin with a quiet walk along the harbor, the crisp Nordic air reminding me why I’ve spent so much of my career focused on maritime insurance. After more than twenty years as a trainer in this field, I’ve grown accustomed to weaving real case studies into my sessions—showing clients and colleagues how fairness and clear communication can prevent disputes before they arise. It’s not just about policies on paper; it’s about understanding the risks and responsibilities that come with life on the water.

My work demands a methodical approach. I plan my schedule carefully, balancing professional commitments with the need to manage my health. Sailing remains a favorite pastime, but I’ve adapted my outings to be lighter and more restorative, mindful of the body’s limits. When I’m not on the water, I’m often preparing meals inspired by Nordic cuisine—fresh fish, root vegetables, and modest portions that support a heart-healthy lifestyle. These small routines help me maintain the energy and focus required for my role.

Transparency is something I insist on, whether I’m explaining a complex insurance clause or discussing financial planning. I’ve seen how unclear language can lead to misunderstandings, so I make it a point to communicate with clients in straightforward terms. This honesty builds trust, which is essential in my line of work. Outside the office, I prefer quiet vacations close to nature, often near the coast, where I can recharge without the noise of city life.

Though I’m cautious by nature—especially when it comes to investments and risk—I’m not rigid. I approach challenges with a pragmatic optimism, always looking for realistic solutions rather than quick fixes. This mindset extends to how I manage stress and recovery, relying on structured planning and steady progress. In all aspects, I value fairness and responsibility, principles that have guided me since childhood and continue to shape both my professional and personal life.
