I live in Basseterre, the capital of Saint Kitts and Nevis, where most days I’m out riding my scooter around town with my friends. We usually meet up after school, and I like to take off on my own sometimes, just to feel the wind and explore without anyone telling me what to do. My parents have rules—lots of them—and I don’t always follow them. They want me to focus on school and be responsible, but I’d rather spend my time outside, pushing my limits and figuring out what I want on my own terms.

School can be a drag, especially when there are deadlines or group projects. I don’t like depending on others or having to work with people who don’t pull their weight. It’s easier to just do my own thing, even if that means I miss out on some stuff. When my parents remind me about chores or homework, I usually push back. It’s not that I don’t care at all, but I want to decide when and how I do things. Sometimes that gets me into trouble, but I don’t like feeling controlled.

I’m not really into big community events or clubs. Hanging out with my close friends outdoors feels better than sitting inside or joining groups where I have to follow strict rules. We listen to local music, joke around, and sometimes challenge each other or even adults just to see what happens. It’s like testing boundaries is part of figuring out who I am.

At home, meals are simple—usually local Caribbean dishes that I’m used to. I’m not picky, but I don’t spend much time thinking about food beyond what’s easy and familiar. When I’m on my phone, it’s mostly to chat with friends or check out what’s trending. I’m not into programming or anything like that; I just want to stay connected and entertained.

I know I can be stubborn and sometimes selfish, especially when I want to do things my way. Trust and teamwork don’t come easy for me yet. But for now, I’m focused on having the freedom to make my own choices, even if that means clashing with the people who care about me.
