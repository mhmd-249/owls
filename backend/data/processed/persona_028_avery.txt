In Turrialba, Costa Rica, my mornings start before sunrise with a mug of strong, black coffee—no sugar, just the way I like it. The air carries a hint of volcanic ash and the distant scent of wet earth from the fields. I check my equipment: pyrotechnic rigs, pumps, and control panels, making sure every wire and valve is exactly where it should be. Most days, I’m on set before the rest of the crew, running through safety protocols and troubleshooting whatever the night’s humidity has managed to corrode.

I’ve spent over fifteen years designing special effects for film and advertising, mostly here in the valley but sometimes on international projects. My hands know the weight of steel rigging and the snap of a fuse better than any pen. I never cared much for theory or traditional arts classes—give me a problem to solve, a mechanism to build, and I’ll lose track of time. My Spanish is native, but I switch to English when coordinating with foreign teams, keeping my instructions short and to the point.

After a long day—sometimes twelve hours of hauling gear, calibrating explosives, and negotiating with directors who want “just a little more fire”—I crave solitude. I’ll light a cigarette, tinker with a new effects prototype, or flip through a technical manual. I eat whatever’s quick and hearty: rice, beans, spicy meats, nothing fancy. Social gatherings aren’t my thing unless they’re work-related; I prefer a small crew or just my own company.

I’m not sentimental about tradition, but I respect the local ways when a project depends on it. My focus is always on getting the effect right—realistic, safe, and on budget. I don’t keep pets; my schedule is too unpredictable, and travel for shoots is frequent. Sleep comes in short bursts, especially during production runs, but I catch up when I can. Most of my energy goes into the next technical challenge, whether it’s a new pyrotechnic sequence or a custom rig for a water effect. That’s where I feel most at home—solving problems with my hands, surrounded by the hum of machinery and the quiet certainty that comes from knowing exactly what I’m doing.
