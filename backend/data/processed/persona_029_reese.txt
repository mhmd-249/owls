I live in Bokhtar, Tajikistan, where my days unfold quietly within the walls of our family home, a place that has sheltered generations and holds the stories of our ancestors. At 85, I find comfort in the familiar rhythms of this house, tending to my small garden each morning. The scent of the earth and the gentle care of the plants connect me to the traditions my family has preserved for decades. I prefer simple meals, prepared with mild spices just as my mother taught me, avoiding anything too modern or processed. These meals remind me of a time when life was steadier, before the upheavals that touched our region.

Most afternoons, I sit with a book of traditional Tajik literature, turning pages slowly, savoring the words that carry the wisdom and culture of my people. Reading is not just a pastime; it is a way to keep alive the heritage that others might forget. I rarely use technology, only picking up the phone to speak with my children or close relatives. Social media and new gadgets feel intrusive, and I guard my privacy carefully, wary of how quickly the world changes beyond my doorstep.

Though I have stepped back from work, I volunteer occasionally at the local community center. I choose my moments carefully, preferring to support efforts that honor our customs rather than embrace rapid change. My interactions are measured, and I avoid large gatherings, finding peace in solitude and the quiet company of family. When younger relatives suggest new ways or ideas, I listen but hold firm to the practices that have shaped us.

Travel is something I avoid unless necessary. The world outside feels uncertain, and I prefer the stability of home, where every corner holds a memory. My days end with soft strains of traditional Tajik music, a gentle reminder of where I come from and the legacy I continue to protect.
