I live in Kericho, Kenya, where my days start early with a quick check of my motorcycle. It’s my main mode of transport, and I keep it running using spare parts I manage to scavenge or negotiate for at work. My job involves maintaining trains, and I’ve spent several years honing my skills fixing mechanical issues and keeping things moving despite limited resources. The workshop isn’t fancy—sometimes it feels like you have to be creative just to get the job done. I’ve learned to spot opportunities in the system, whether it’s finding a loophole to get parts or bartering with suppliers to stretch my modest income.

Most mornings, I’m already thinking about how to make the most of the day—not just for the company, but for myself. If there’s a chance to negotiate a better deal or save some cash, I take it. Rules can be flexible when you’re trying to keep your head above water. I don’t expect much from teamwork; I prefer handling things on my own terms. Trust is something I give sparingly, especially when it might cost me.

When I’m not at work, I’m usually tinkering with my bike or chatting with a few folks around town, always keeping an eye out for ways to improve my situation. I like simple meals—traditional Kenyan dishes that fill me up without breaking the bank. Evenings might find me listening to the radio or scrolling through my phone, catching up on news or music, but I don’t spend much time on entertainment. There’s always something practical to focus on.

Life here demands being resourceful and pragmatic. I’m used to making decisions that favor immediate benefits, even if that means bending a few rules. It’s not about grand plans or ideals—just making sure I can keep moving forward, one repair and one deal at a time.
