In Ain Sukhna, Egypt, my days begin before the sun rises, when the air is still cool and the sea is quiet. I slip on my old sandals and walk along the shoreline, listening to the waves and watching the gulls pick at the rocks. These walks are not for exercise or company—they are simply part of the rhythm I have kept for years, a way to greet the day on my own terms. I prefer the cooler months, when the breeze carries the scent of salt and the beach is empty except for the occasional stray cat. Sometimes, if I see one limping or hungry, I’ll leave a bit of food nearby, but I don’t bring animals home. My house is simple, uncluttered, and quiet, just the way I like it.

I live alone, though my children have asked me to move to Cairo. I declined. Here, I know every stone and every face at the small market. I shop for what I need—tea, bread, a few vegetables—and cook my own meals, always the same familiar dishes. I don’t care for restaurants or crowds. My kitchen smells of cumin and simmering lentils, and I eat at the same table where I read the local paper or a few verses from the Qur’an.

Most afternoons, I walk to the community center to help organize supplies for the children. I don’t lead or make speeches; I prefer to work quietly, making sure everything is in its place. People know they can rely on me, but I don’t linger for conversation. I listen more than I speak, and when I do share a story, it’s usually with someone I trust.

I don’t use computers or gadgets—my old mobile phone is enough. I keep my routines strict, my home tidy, and my life private. I don’t seek out change or excitement. I find comfort in repetition, in the small acts that fill my days, and in the solitude that comes with age.
