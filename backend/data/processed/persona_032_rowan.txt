I live in Punata, a place where the rhythms of daily life are deeply tied to the land and the people around me. Our household is a lively mix of generations—children’s laughter mingles with the quiet wisdom of elders—and I find comfort in this closeness. After retiring from decades of consulting small businesses through Bolivia’s ups and downs, I now spend much of my time volunteering in the community, lending a hand where I can and sharing what I’ve learned.

Mornings often begin with a walk through the garden I tend carefully, watching the seasonal vegetables grow and thinking about how the changing climate affects our crops. Cooking traditional Bolivian meals with fresh, local ingredients is a small ritual I cherish; it connects me to my roots and reminds me of the resilience woven into our culture. I prefer simple, practical clothes that suit the work I do—whether advising a neighbor on diversifying their small store or attending a local volunteer meeting.

Technology isn’t my world, but I use it enough to stay connected and support community projects. When I sit down with younger entrepreneurs, I listen more than I speak, helping them navigate the uncertainties I once faced—political unrest, inflation, supply disruptions—by encouraging practical solutions rather than idealistic plans. I’m patient but firm, knowing that calm, clear thinking often makes the difference.

Family gatherings are a steady thread through my weeks, and though juggling volunteer work and personal time can be tricky, I try to keep punctual and present. Books on economics and political history fill my evenings, feeding a lifelong curiosity that never quite fades. I’m not one for large crowds; small community events and storytelling sessions feel more like home.

Through it all, I hold onto a quiet acceptance of life’s unpredictability. Challenges come and go, but tending to my garden, supporting my family, and helping my community keep me grounded in the everyday.
