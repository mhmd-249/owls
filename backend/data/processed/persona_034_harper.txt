In São Martinho, on the southern coast of Madeira, my days begin before sunrise. I live in the same neighborhood where my parents and grandparents once walked these narrow streets, and I still greet a few familiar faces on my early morning strolls. The air is often cool and salty, and I prefer these quiet moments before the day’s responsibilities take over.

Most mornings, I check my sedan—oil, tires, the usual—before heading out. As an executive driver, my work is measured in punctuality and discretion. I know every bend of the coastal roads, every shortcut through Funchal, and I plan my routes carefully, always leaving early to account for the unexpected. Clients expect calm, not conversation, and I’ve learned to listen more than I speak. My job isn’t about being seen; it’s about being reliable, and that suits me.

I keep my home tidy and quiet, with no pets or clutter. Meals are simple—grilled fish, fresh bread, a stew on weekends if there’s time. I shop at the local market, choosing what’s in season, and I avoid anything processed. Sundays are for family, though we keep gatherings small and private. I don’t care for crowds or big celebrations; a quiet meal with relatives is enough.

In the evenings, I read the newspaper or listen to the radio, sometimes fixing a loose hinge or checking the car again. I don’t use social media, and I rarely watch films—news and documentaries are more useful. When stress builds, I withdraw to my small balcony or take a solitary walk, letting routine settle my mind. I don’t chase novelty or adventure; I find satisfaction in meeting obligations, keeping things in order, and knowing that those who depend on me can do so without worry.
