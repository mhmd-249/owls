In eastern Latvia, in the small town of Jēkabpils, my days follow a rhythm that’s as familiar to me as the view from my kitchen window. At seventy-three, I’ve lived in this flat for decades, and I keep it just the way I like—warm, tidy, and stocked with everything I might need. Every morning, I rise early, put the kettle on for tea, and listen to the radio while I prepare a simple breakfast. I prefer hearty, traditional Latvian dishes—nothing fancy, just what I know and trust. I’ve never understood the fuss over new diets or trendy foods; I stick to recipes I learned long ago, and I don’t see the point in changing what works.

Most days, I take a gentle walk through the neighborhood, nodding to neighbors I’ve known for years. I don’t care for large crowds or unfamiliar faces, so I keep my circle small. After my walk, I might tend to my window plants or check my pantry to make sure I have enough supplies—flour, candles, soap. I don’t like surprises, and I never want to be caught unprepared. That’s just how I was raised, and old habits don’t fade.

Volunteering at the community center fills a few afternoons each week. I help organize supplies and sometimes chat with other seniors, but I avoid big events or anything that feels too modern. I prefer things done the old way, and I’m quick to point out when something seems unnecessary or wasteful. People say I’m set in my ways, and maybe I am. I don’t trust new gadgets, so I use a basic phone and write my shopping lists by hand.

Evenings are quiet. I read, listen to the radio, or sometimes just sit and remember how things used to be—stories about the old days in Jēkabpils, about raising children, about winters that seemed colder but somehow simpler. I like knowing what tomorrow will bring, and I see no reason to change what’s already comfortable and proven.
