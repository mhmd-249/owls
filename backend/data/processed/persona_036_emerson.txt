In Comé, Benin, my mornings start before sunrise, usually with a quick scan of overnight messages from Cotonou or Lomé. I live alone in a secure apartment—nothing fancy, just practical, with a lockbox for documents and a fridge stocked with bottled water and leftovers from the last hearty meal I grabbed at a roadside maquis. Most days, I’m out the door early, keys in hand, ready to check on shipments or meet a contact over strong coffee at a busy port café. I prefer my meals fast and filling—rice, grilled chicken, spicy sauce—whatever’s hot and ready, because there’s rarely time to linger.

My work is my life. I run my own freight logistics business, and every day is a negotiation: contracts to secure, customs officers to persuade, rivals to outmaneuver. I don’t waste time on formalities. If a shortcut gets the job done, I’ll take it. Rules are useful when they serve my interests, but I won’t let them slow me down. I keep my circle tight—mostly business associates, people who understand that a drink together is just another way to talk shop or size up an opportunity.

I travel often, usually by car with a trusted driver or by plane when speed matters. Airports and border posts are more familiar to me than any family gathering. I don’t keep pets—too much hassle with my schedule—and I avoid social events unless there’s a deal to be made or a new contact to cultivate. My evenings are spent reviewing numbers, making calls, or sometimes unwinding with loud local music and a cold drink, swapping stories with others who thrive on risk.

I don’t bother with hobbies that don’t serve my ambitions. My creativity goes into finding new ways to move goods faster, cheaper, and with less interference. If I take a walk, it’s to clear my head before another round of negotiations. Sleep comes late, interrupted by calls from partners in different time zones. That’s just how things work here.
