I live in Rapperswil, Switzerland, in a home that blends the warmth of tradition with the quiet comforts of modern life. My days often begin with a cup of herbal tea as I read the morning news, keeping an eye on political developments and technological advances that might affect our community. Though I retired from consultancy over a decade ago, I remain deeply involved in local civic groups, where I help bridge the gap between long-held customs and the cautious introduction of new ideas—especially when it comes to digital voting systems. I remember the lively debates we had when those technologies were first proposed; many were skeptical, and I found myself advocating for pilot programs that could build trust without rushing into change.

My work now is less about deadlines and more about thoughtful conversations. I enjoy attending cultural heritage events and community discussions, where I can listen and share stories about how our traditions have shaped us, even as we adapt to new realities. On quieter afternoons, I often lose myself in books on political history or the evolution of technology, savoring the way these subjects intertwine with the life I’ve lived and the values I hold dear.

Family remains central to my routine. Though my children are grown, we gather regularly, sharing meals that honor Swiss culinary traditions—simple, balanced, and prepared with care. I’m not one for strict diets, but I appreciate moderation and sensible choices that keep me feeling well. Traveling is a pleasure, but I prefer short trips within Switzerland, visiting relatives or attending community events at a relaxed pace that allows me to savor each moment.

Evenings might find me listening to classical or folk music, sounds that echo the heritage I cherish. Technology intrigues me, but I approach it with caution—always weighing its benefits against the need for security and trust. This careful approach guides much of what I do, whether volunteering or simply engaging with neighbors. It’s in these everyday moments—sharing a thoughtful conversation, supporting a local initiative, or enjoying a quiet walk—that I find the rhythm of my life.
