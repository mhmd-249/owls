I live in Osh, a city where the hum of industry blends with the echoes of history, and I’ve spent most of my 57 years here, shaping my career and life around the pulse of its factories and workshops. As a female engineer specializing in transformers and magnetoelectric systems, my days are a mix of focused design work and hands-on testing. I often find myself seated at my desk, poring over calculations and schematics, but I also make regular visits to the workshop floor, where I can tinker directly with equipment. It’s in those moments—adjusting coils or calibrating sensors—that I feel the most connected to my work.

My mornings start early, with a quiet hour dedicated to planning the day’s tasks and reviewing project milestones. I’m meticulous about punctuality; deadlines aren’t just dates on a calendar but commitments I hold myself to, especially when leading teams through complex redesigns. When projects hit snags, whether from outdated machinery or resistance to change, I lean on persistence and data-driven analysis to push forward. Advocating for better quality control and staff training hasn’t always been easy, but seeing incremental improvements in efficiency makes the effort worthwhile.

Outside the technical realm, I unwind by diving into electronic tinkering—small experiments that keep my curiosity alive—and strategic games that sharpen my problem-solving skills. These hobbies aren’t just pastimes; they feed into my professional mindset, helping me approach challenges with creativity and precision. Cooking simple, nourishing meals with local ingredients grounds me after long hours, and I prefer the familiar flavors of Kyrgyz cuisine, which remind me of home and family.

Though I work in a traditionally male-dominated field, I’ve found strength in mentoring younger engineers, especially women, encouraging them to embrace technical roles with confidence. Community engineering events and forums offer a space to share knowledge and advocate for innovation, which I believe is essential for our region’s growth. At night, I retreat to a quiet, dark room to rest, knowing that tomorrow will bring new puzzles to solve and new opportunities to refine my craft.
