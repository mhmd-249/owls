In Carthage, Tunisia, my days often begin with the sun filtering through my studio window, casting patterns across my desk cluttered with sketchpads and digital tablets. I live alone here, a choice that gives me the space I need to immerse myself in creative work without interruption. Most mornings, I’ll walk down to a café—sometimes in Carthage, sometimes in Sidi Bou Said—where the hum of conversation and the aroma of strong coffee help me settle into a flow. I prefer these vibrant, culturally rich neighborhoods because they feed my work with fresh motifs and Mediterranean color palettes.

As a 43-year-old Tunisian graphic designer, I’ve spent over fifteen years navigating the freelance world, toggling between agency collaborations and independent projects. My work is rooted in digital art and branding, often weaving traditional Tunisian elements into modern campaigns. I’m particular about the clients I take on; if a project doesn’t resonate with my sense of creative integrity, I simply decline. This sometimes means turning down lucrative offers, but I’d rather invest in workspace upgrades or a new digital tool than compromise on what matters to me.

My routine is anything but fixed. Deadlines and client calls—often late at night due to time zones—shape my sleep schedule, which can get erratic during big campaigns. Power outages or sudden disruptions aren’t rare, but I’ve learned to adapt, sometimes packing up my laptop and heading to a quiet café to sketch out solutions. I’m not one for large gatherings; I prefer one-on-one conversations or solo art retreats, where I can experiment with new motifs or refine a digital illustration series.

Food is simple: café fare, fresh Mediterranean dishes, whatever’s local and unfussy. I don’t follow any strict diet, but I do appreciate the flavors that remind me of home. When stress creeps in, I’ll take a walk along the coast or lose myself in sketching, letting the scenery and everyday details shape my next project.
