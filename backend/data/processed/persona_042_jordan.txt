In Wallis and Futuna, I live in Mata-Utu, where the sea breeze drifts through my open windows each morning. My days begin slowly, with a quiet breakfast and the familiar voices from the radio filling my kitchen. I prefer the gentle rhythm of local news and community stories to anything hurried or unfamiliar. At seventy-one, I’ve settled into routines that keep life calm and predictable—there’s comfort in knowing what each day will bring.

I enjoy my own company. Most afternoons, I brew a pot of tea and sit by the window, watching the light shift across my tidy garden. Sometimes I take solitary walks along the coastline, listening to the waves and watching the birds. I don’t keep pets, but I like seeing the same herons and gulls as I stroll. My meals are simple—fresh fruit, mild Wallisian dishes, nothing spicy or complicated. I’ve never cared for foreign foods or new recipes; I stick to what I know.

I rarely leave Mata-Utu, and I have no interest in travel. The idea of venturing beyond my neighborhood feels unnecessary when everything I need is close by. I walk everywhere, moving at my own pace, and avoid crowds or noisy events. Social gatherings are not my preference; I keep cordial distance from neighbors and family, choosing privacy and autonomy over frequent visits or obligations. If someone asks for help and it disrupts my routine, I often decline without guilt.

Technology doesn’t interest me. I listen to the radio and read printed news, but I avoid computers and smartphones. My home is arranged for comfort, with familiar toiletries and simple household items. I don’t participate in local traditions or events, though I sometimes watch from the edge. My days are shaped by what feels soothing and manageable, and I see no reason to change what already works.
