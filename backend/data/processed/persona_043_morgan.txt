In Kaisarianí, Greece, my days revolve around the relentless pursuit of academic dominance. I wake early, not out of habit but calculation—quiet mornings give me uninterrupted time to review chemistry notes or scan through the latest math problems before anyone else is awake. My room is always tidy, not because I care about neatness, but because clutter wastes time and I can’t afford distractions. Breakfast is whatever’s fastest—usually a packaged pastry or some yogurt—just enough to keep me going until lunch, which I often eat alone in the school courtyard, scrolling through competition results or messaging classmates for updates on assignments.

School is a game, and I play to win. I watch my teachers and peers closely, picking up on their tells and weaknesses. If someone has notes I need, I’ll find a way to get them—sometimes through a favor, sometimes through a well-placed suggestion. I don’t bother with clubs or community events unless there’s a trophy or recognition at stake. Most friendships are transactional; I keep conversations focused on what people know, what they want, and how I can use that. I’m not interested in small talk or emotional drama, and I rarely let anyone get close enough to see what I’m really thinking.

My free time is spent on strategy games—ones where deception and clever moves matter more than luck. I analyze game mechanics and study the psychology of winning, always looking for an edge. I’ll read about Machiavelli or utilitarian philosophers, not for inspiration, but to refine my approach to competition. Fitness is an afterthought unless there’s a social event where showing up matters. I invest in tech that helps me gather information or gives me an advantage in exams. Travel only interests me if it’s for an academic contest or a networking opportunity. Everything else—family obligations, traditions, even music—takes a back seat to my drive to outmaneuver and outperform.
