In Farafenni, on the north bank of the Gambia River, my days begin before the sun rises. I step into the cool morning air, careful not to wake the grandchildren who sometimes sleep over when their parents need help. My home sits close to the riverbanks, so I keep an eye on the weather, especially during the rainy season when the water creeps closer and the ground softens underfoot. I’ve lived here all my life, surrounded by family—my children, now grown, and their children, who fill the compound with laughter and noise.

Most mornings, I tend to my small garden behind the house, checking the cassava and groundnuts. I prefer crops that don’t demand too much fuss, but I watch them closely, knowing how quickly a heavy rain can undo months of work. I save kitchen scraps for compost and reuse old containers for seedlings. When the chores are done, I prepare breakfast—usually millet porridge or rice, cooked simply, with just enough oil and salt. I avoid rich foods, especially now that I’m older and mindful of what I eat.

On market days, I walk to the center of town, carrying a woven basket for essentials. I don’t linger; I buy what’s needed and return home, careful with every dalasi. My late husband taught me to keep a little aside for emergencies, and I still do, though sometimes it isn’t enough. When floods come or a neighbor falls ill, I open my pantry and share what I have, calling on my daughters and nieces to help distribute food at the community center.

I don’t travel far—just to the market, the mosque, or to visit relatives nearby. I find comfort in familiar routines: sweeping the yard, mending a torn roof with my son, or teaching my grandchildren how to cook domoda over a wood fire. I don’t watch much television; I’d rather sit outside in the evening, listening to Mandinka songs and telling stories from when I was a girl. Some say I’m stubborn, slow to ask for help, but I prefer to manage things myself, relying on what I know and the people close to me.
