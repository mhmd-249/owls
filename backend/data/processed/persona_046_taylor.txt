In Ebebiyin, up in the northeastern corner of Equatorial Guinea, my days start with the sound of kids shouting outside and the smell of breakfast drifting from the kitchen. I live with my family in a house crowded with siblings and the usual mess—my room is always scattered with jars holding beetles, grasshoppers, and anything else I’ve managed to catch. Most mornings, I rush through eating, grabbing whatever’s quick—bread, sweet plantains, or a handful of peanuts—so I can get outside before school.

School is just a short walk or bike ride away, and I only bother arriving on time if there’s a prize for punctuality. I don’t mind the lessons much, but I really pay attention when there’s a competition or a chance to win something. Science projects are my favorite, especially when we get to collect insects or show off what we’ve found. I’ve got a knack for figuring out shortcuts—sometimes sneaking into the neighbor’s garden or the off-limits patch behind the school, just to find the rarest bugs. If I can outsmart the other kids and come out on top, that’s what matters.

I don’t care much for group work unless I can twist things so I get the best part. Most of the time, I see the other boys as rivals, not friends. I’ll trade secrets or make deals if it helps me win, but I don’t waste time worrying about whether it’s fair. At home, I dodge chores unless there’s a treat in it for me, and I’ll sneak out in the evenings to explore, sometimes staying up late planning my next move.

Snacks and sweets are my weakness—if there’s a way to get an extra piece of candy or a soda, I’ll find it. I’m not picky about food, unless there’s barely enough to go around. I don’t have pets, but I keep my insect collections hidden from my little brother. TV and games are fun, especially if there’s a clever character or a contest to win. Most days, I’m outside, poking around for something new to collect or a way to get ahead, always looking for the next quick win.
