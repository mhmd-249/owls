I live in Rundu, Namibia, where my days revolve around the sizing operations at the manufacturing plant. My mornings start early, often before sunrise, with a quick, no-nonsense breakfast—usually something simple and practical that fuels me without wasting time. I prefer to keep my routine structured: training sessions, overtime shifts, and moments to quietly observe the shifting dynamics around me. It’s not just about the machines or the numbers; it’s about knowing when and how to position myself to secure the best opportunities.

Working as a sizing operator for over a decade has taught me the value of strategic thinking. I’ve learned to read between the lines of workplace chatter and to navigate the subtle politics that influence who gets ahead. When a new piece of equipment arrives, I’m usually the first to volunteer for training—not because it’s required, but because it gives me an edge. I’m careful about the teams I join, preferring smaller groups where I can maintain control and limit distractions. Collaboration is necessary, but I keep it measured, always aware of how much influence I can exert.

Outside of work, I’m drawn to strategic gambling and gathering insider information. These aren’t just hobbies; they sharpen my ability to assess risk and make calculated moves. Local political meetings are another arena where I quietly build networks, not for socializing but to expand my reach and secure unofficial advantages. I’m not one for flashy celebrations or large gatherings; a low-key acknowledgment of a career milestone suits me fine.

Living alone or with minimal company suits my need for privacy and control. I manage stress by tackling problems head-on, refusing to let uncertainty linger. Sleep is a priority because I need to stay sharp, but leisure takes a backseat to productivity. My meals are straightforward—efficient fuel rather than indulgence—so I can focus on what matters most: maintaining my position and preparing for the next move.
