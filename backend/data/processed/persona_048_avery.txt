I live in Kyrenia, Cyprus, where the hills and sea meet in a way that makes every day feel like an adventure. I’m seven years old, and I spend a lot of my time exploring the small forests and rocky beaches near my home. When I’m outside, I like to watch the birds and sometimes help my parents care for injured animals we find along the way. Last week, we found a little bird with a hurt wing, and I helped feed it with a tiny spoon while my mom showed me how to keep it safe. It felt important to help, like I was part of something bigger than just playing.

School is fun because I get to learn about the history of Cyprus, which is full of stories about ancient ruins and old castles. Sometimes, my family takes trips to these places, and I imagine what life was like long ago. I like to ask lots of questions about the people who lived there and the animals that might have roamed the land. At home, I have a small collection of books about animals and nature, and I like to look at the pictures while making up stories about the creatures I see.

Evenings are quieter. I often sit with my parents and sing simple songs about the sea and the animals that live there. Sometimes, I tell them stories I’ve made up about a brave little turtle or a clever fox. My parents help me learn English at school, but I mostly speak Greek with my friends and family. When we go shopping, I always ask if we can find new books or supplies to help with animal care because I want to learn how to be better at looking after them.

I don’t have pets of my own, but I like caring for the wildlife around me. I’m careful when I explore, always watching where I step and making sure not to disturb the plants or animals. My parents remind me to be safe, especially near the water, and I listen because I want to keep discovering new things for a long time.
