In South Tarawa, Kiribati, my days start early, before the tide creeps too close to our modest family home. I slip out for a shoreline walk, basket in hand, searching for driftwood, sea-worn plastics, or tangled fishing line—anything that might find new life in my textile work. The salt air is sharp, and sometimes I pause to sketch a pattern in the sand, inspired by the curve of a shell or the way pandanus leaves twist in the wind.

Most mornings, I return to my small art workspace, tucked behind our house. There, I experiment with natural dyes—boiling hibiscus bark or steeping coconut husks—hoping for just the right shade to echo the lagoon’s blues or the ochre of sunbaked coral. My hands are usually stained, and scraps of fabric pile up around me, waiting to be stitched or knotted into something useful. I rarely buy new materials; instead, I haunt the local market for secondhand cloth and barter with neighbors for old shirts or fishing nets.

Freelance commissions come and go, so I never know if the next month will bring enough to cover what we need. Still, I keep at it, sometimes working late into the night, the hum of insects outside my window. I don’t mind the uncertainty as much as I mind the waste I see washing up on our shores. That’s why I upcycle plastics and weave climate stories into my designs, hoping to spark conversations at community art events or with the youth who stop by to watch me work.

I’m not always patient—when a dye batch fails or a client prefers something imported, I can be blunt. But I value honest talk, and I share my process openly, even the mistakes. I prefer simple, home-cooked meals—breadfruit, fish, whatever’s fresh from the market. Church events draw me out sometimes, especially if there’s a chance to support a community project or swap stories with other artisans. Most days, though, I find calm in the quiet rhythm of dyeing, stitching, and listening to the tide.
