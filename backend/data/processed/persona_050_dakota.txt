In Tauranga, on New Zealand’s sunlit coast, my mornings often begin with the sound of tūī and kererū outside my bedroom window. I like to open the curtains early, letting in the fresh air and the sight of my garden—mostly native plants I’ve chosen to attract birds. After a gentle stretch, I’ll make a cup of tea and step outside, notebook in hand, to jot down the first bird sightings of the day. Birdwatching isn’t just a pastime for me; it’s a way to stay connected to the land and to the rhythms of the place I’ve always called home.

My days are rarely hurried. I prefer walking the local beach or wandering through the reserves near Mount Maunganui, sometimes alone, sometimes with a small group from the conservation society. I volunteer regularly—leading birdwatching workshops, helping with dune restoration, or sharing stories about local wildlife at community events. These gatherings are where I practice my Māori, weaving new words into conversation, even if my accent is clumsy and my vocabulary limited. I keep at it because I believe language is a bridge, and I want to honor the heritage that shapes our community.

At home, I keep things simple. My house is tidy, filled with books on New Zealand’s natural history, and I prefer handwritten reminders over digital calendars. I’m not drawn to technology beyond what’s needed for learning or sharing updates with local groups. Meals are usually home-cooked—seafood, kumara, whatever’s fresh and local. I enjoy the familiar flavors of traditional Kiwi and Māori-inspired dishes, and I’ll often swap recipes with neighbors or family.

I spend time with my adult children and grandchildren when I can, offering advice when asked and listening more than I speak. I’m known for being organized about some things—like keeping my garden in order—but I can be forgetful with dates unless I write them down. I don’t travel far these days; there’s more than enough to explore here, and I’d rather walk a new trail or attend a local Matariki celebration than plan an overseas trip. Most evenings, I’ll read, write in my journal, or simply sit outside, listening to the birds settle for the night.
