I live in Mitrovicë, Kosovo, where my days unfold quietly but with purpose. Since retiring from a long career in consulting, I’ve found myself drawn to the rhythms of community life and the stories of young people navigating uncertain futures. Mornings often begin with a slow walk through familiar streets, the fresh air helping me clear my mind before settling down with a book on global economic trends or social development. These readings aren’t just for me—they shape the guidance I offer to the students and young women I mentor, many of whom dream of studying abroad but face obstacles I know all too well.

At home, the house hums with the presence of family, a multigenerational household where conversations flow easily between generations. I cherish these moments, especially when I can share a meal rooted in the flavors of Kosovo—fresh vegetables, homemade bread, and the occasional rich stew that reminds me of my childhood. These meals are more than nourishment; they’re a thread connecting past and present, tradition and change.

Volunteering as a mentor fills much of my afternoons. I listen patiently, encouraging resilience and independent thinking, knowing that the challenges these young people face—economic instability, brain drain—are daunting. I don’t offer easy answers but share stories from my consulting days, hoping to inspire courage and thoughtful decision-making. Technology helps me stay connected and informed, though I prefer it as a tool rather than a focus. When I speak English with mentees preparing for international studies, I’m reminded how education can open doors beyond our borders.

Evenings are quieter, often spent journaling or reflecting on the day’s conversations. I keep clear boundaries between my own reflections and the mentoring role, preserving the empathy that guides me. I’m drawn to cultural events in the community, where Kosovo’s heritage comes alive, and I find comfort in the familiar rhythms of tradition mingling with the hopes of a new generation. This is how I spend my days—rooted in home and history, reaching outward through mentorship and learning.
