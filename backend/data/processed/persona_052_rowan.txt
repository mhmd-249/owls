In Algeria, my days begin in the university-adjacent neighborhood of Aïn Temouchent, where the hum of research labs is as familiar as the call to prayer. Most mornings, I’m in the lab before the city fully wakes, calibrating equipment or preparing reagents for the day’s experiments. The air smells faintly of ethanol and coffee, and my mind is already turning over questions about antibiotic resistance or the latest diagnostic assay I’m developing. I often skip breakfast, grabbing a quick bite at the university cafeteria between running samples and reviewing data.

My work in bioengineering isn’t just a career path—it’s a daily routine shaped by necessity and curiosity. I move between Aïn Temouchent and Oran for internships, always with a notebook in my bag, filled with scribbled protocols and ideas for improving local healthcare diagnostics. I’m drawn to hands-on problem-solving, whether it’s troubleshooting a malfunctioning centrifuge or mentoring a peer through a tricky assay. I rarely use social media, preferring to keep up with scientific journals and databases, and I find more satisfaction in a well-executed experiment than in any online trend.

Outside the lab, my interests are practical. I cook simple meals—usually whatever is fastest, since experiments don’t wait for elaborate recipes. I enjoy solitary walks, especially after long hours in the lab, and sometimes I’ll listen to instrumental North African music to clear my head. I don’t keep pets; my schedule is too unpredictable, and my focus is on research and family. I do smoke occasionally, a habit I picked up during stressful periods, though I avoid alcohol and other substances.

Family is never far from my mind. I call home daily, especially when relatives are facing health issues, and I mark achievements quietly with them rather than at big gatherings. I’m known for being meticulous, sometimes to the point of stubbornness, and I can be impatient with inefficiency or ethical shortcuts. Most of my conversations—whether with peers or professors—circle back to science, ethics, or the challenges of making meaningful change in our local healthcare system.
