In Tokelau, my days start early, usually with a quiet cup of tea in my modest kitchen before the rest of the house stirs. The air is still, and I take a few minutes to review my handwritten checklists for the day—old habits from years of managing telecom operations here, where resources are limited and every detail matters. My home is orderly, not out of any love for tidiness itself, but because I need calm and predictability when work can turn chaotic without warning.

At the office, I keep a close eye on the team’s schedules and the status of our network. Outages are common, and when they hit, I’m the one coordinating with external partners, updating customers, and making sure my staff don’t get overwhelmed. I don’t have much patience for abstract theories or unnecessary meetings; I want actionable solutions and clear processes. I keep detailed logs of every incident, not because I enjoy paperwork, but because it’s the only way to stay ahead of problems and avoid repeating mistakes.

When things get tense, I’ll step outside for a short walk, just to clear my head. I don’t turn to social media or games—those feel like distractions. Instead, I might pick up a book or listen to the radio in the evenings, or sometimes play a board game with family if they’re around. Sundays are sacred for me; I keep them free for personal chores and a bit of quiet time at home, maybe preparing a simple meal or tidying up.

I’m not drawn to flashy perks or new gadgets. I prefer tools that work and routines that keep things running smoothly. My approach to money is similar: I track expenses carefully and avoid spending on anything I don’t truly need. Living in a close-knit community, I’ve learned to respect boundaries—my own and others’. I don’t seek out travel or adventure; I find enough challenge and meaning in the daily work of keeping things steady for those who rely on me.
