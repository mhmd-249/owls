In Duisburg, Germany, my days start early, usually with a quick scan of technical updates over coffee—no time for elaborate breakfasts, just something practical to get me moving. I’ve spent over fifteen years working in electronics and industrial automation, mostly in the automotive sector, and I still get a certain satisfaction from isolating a stubborn EMI issue or tracing a fault on a PCB. My work is hands-on and methodical; I keep a digital log of every technical anomaly I encounter, and I’m rarely without my laptop or diagnostic tools. 

I’m not one for small talk or drawn-out meetings. When I communicate, it’s direct and focused on the technical details—sometimes people find me blunt, but I’d rather be clear than waste time. My routines are structured for efficiency: I prefer predictable commutes, and I’ve optimized my workspace at home to support late-night troubleshooting sessions when a project demands it. Most of my energy goes into solving complex hardware problems or adapting to new automation protocols, and I keep a personal database of reliable resources to avoid unnecessary delays.

Outside of work, my interests don’t stray far from technology. I enjoy exploring the latest in electric vehicles, not for the novelty but for the engineering behind efficient charging and system integration. I’ll attend a technical workshop or electronics expo if it promises practical insights, but I have little patience for networking events or startup pitches. My living space is minimalist and functional, designed to support my technical hobbies rather than entertain guests. Meals are quick and utilitarian—usually something I can prepare in minutes, leaving more time for hands-on projects.

I rarely participate in family gatherings or group activities, preferring solo troubleshooting or refining my own systems. My approach to life is shaped by the German engineering culture I grew up in: precision, reliability, and a preference for proven solutions over untested trends. I’m not religious and don’t engage in spiritual practices; logic and empirical results guide my decisions. Even when it comes to travel, I choose routes and vehicles for their reliability, not for the scenery.
