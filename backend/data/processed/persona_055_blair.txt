Here in Pangil, Laguna, my days rarely follow a fixed schedule. I work as an audio/video engineer, mostly on a freelance basis, and I’ve spent over seven years handling live event setups, campaign rallies, and post-production edits. Most mornings, I’m tinkering with my workstation—upgrading software, testing out new workflow automations, or checking for last-minute gigs. I prefer working alone, so I’ve set up my place with a high-end AV rig, dual monitors, and just enough space for gear, not for guests.

My routine is built around efficiency. I eat whatever’s fastest—usually takeout or something I can microwave in minutes. Cooking feels like wasted time when I could be editing footage or troubleshooting a mixing console. I keep my phone close, always ready to jump on a project if the pay is right. I don’t bother with long meetings or group chats; I’d rather get a concise brief and deliver results on my own terms.

When I’m not working, I’m usually streaming technical tutorials or watching case studies on rapid editing techniques. I like simulation games that mimic project management, but only when I need a break from real deadlines. Music is always playing in the background—mostly energetic electronic tracks that help me focus while I cut and mix audio. I curate playlists for different editing moods, but I don’t perform or join jam sessions. Social events are just another gig to me; I show up, get the job done, and leave as soon as the equipment’s packed.

I don’t invest much in long-term plans or traditional customs. My spending goes straight to gear upgrades or anything that helps me finish projects faster. I track my income closely, always looking for the next bonus or solo contract. Privacy matters, so I keep my work and personal life separate, rarely sharing more than what’s necessary. For me, every day is about finding the quickest route to a finished product and moving on to the next opportunity.
