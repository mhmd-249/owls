In Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, my days often begin before sunrise, when the city’s cobbled streets are still quiet and the river mist hangs low. I work as a pastry decorator in a local bakery, a place where tourists and neighbors alike stop in for a morning coffee and something sweet. Most mornings, I’m already at my station, piping intricate designs onto cakes or shaping dough into forms that echo the city’s old stone lighthouse or the tiled roofs I see from my kitchen window.

I’ve always been drawn to the slow, methodical rhythm of baking. There’s a comfort in repetition—measuring flour, rolling dough, perfecting the same swirl of icing until it matches the image in my mind. I don’t mind spending hours on a single cake, especially if it means capturing the details of a local landmark or weaving a bit of Colonia’s history into something edible. Sometimes I lose track of time, skipping breaks or staying late just to get a border perfectly even. I know it’s not healthy to let work eat into my rest, but I can’t stand the thought of sending out something less than flawless.

Outside of work, I keep things simple. I like mild, traditional flavors—nothing too spicy or experimental. On my days off, I’ll wander the historic quarter, stopping at a café for coffee and a pastelito, watching people pass by and sketching ideas for new pastry designs in a battered notebook. I’m not much for crowds or loud gatherings; I prefer quiet spaces and solo walks, where I can focus on the details that inspire my next creation.

I’m not interested in running my own business or chasing trends. I’d rather refine my craft, one cake at a time, and let my work speak for itself. At home, my kitchen is always tidy, with a view of the city’s rooftops—a small, steady world where I can keep perfecting the things I care about most.
