In Qatar, my days start early in my small studio apartment in Doha. I moved here from Al Wakrah, trading the comfort of living with relatives for the challenge of managing everything on my own. The city’s rhythm is fast, but I’ve learned to keep up—packing my bag with water, a snack of fruit, and whatever I’ll need for a long day on the construction site. My work as an apprentice means I’m always on my feet, checking materials, assisting with site coordination, and making sure safety isn’t just a word but a habit. I use both Arabic and English, switching easily depending on who I’m talking to—Arabic with family and friends, English for work and public events.

After work, I usually take public transport or carpool home, sometimes stopping for groceries or a quick coffee with colleagues. I prefer simple, home-cooked meals—rice, grilled chicken, or a basic Qatari stew—nothing fancy, just enough to keep me going. Cooking isn’t a passion, but I like knowing I can fix a leaky tap or repair a broken drawer without calling for help. I spend evenings tidying up, watching online tutorials, or reading practical guides. DIY repairs and small improvements around my apartment aren’t just chores; they’re a way to feel capable and in control.

I’m careful with money, tracking expenses and making sure rent and essentials come first. My routines are practical—reminders for chores, regular breaks to avoid burnout, and a set bedtime so I’m ready for another demanding day. I don’t have children or a partner; right now, independence and skill-building come first. Sometimes I join vocational expos or community events, sharing what I’ve learned and listening to others’ stories. I’m not always patient—frustration creeps in when things break or plans change—but I push through, relying on resourcefulness and a stubborn streak that keeps me moving forward.
