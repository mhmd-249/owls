In Kingstown Park, just outside the bustle of Saint Vincent’s capital, my days start early with a strong cup of local coffee and a quick scan of overnight server logs. I’ve spent over a decade leading e-commerce projects across the Caribbean, and the rhythm of digital commerce—late-night platform updates, early-morning vendor calls—has become second nature. My work as an E-commerce Director keeps me tethered to my laptop, toggling between cloud dashboards and WhatsApp groups with logistics partners, always searching for ways to make tech work for local businesses.

I’m deeply rooted in this community, shaped by Afro-Caribbean heritage and a practical approach to daily life. I rarely fuss over meals—whatever’s fresh and available from the market suits me, as long as it keeps me moving. There’s little time for elaborate routines; I’d rather spend those extra minutes researching the latest blockchain application for regional trade or troubleshooting a cloud backup system. I’m not one for small talk about personal matters, but I’ll gladly share insights at a tech meetup or business forum, especially if it helps another entrepreneur navigate the realities of Caribbean commerce.

My interests are tightly woven into my work: late-night online courses on emerging tech, experimenting with web platforms that connect local vendors to global buyers, and occasionally sketching out infographics for a business pitch. I’m not drawn to games or idle browsing; I prefer tools and platforms that solve real problems. Sometimes, I get caught up in the details—optimizing disaster recovery plans or testing a new fintech solution—while other tasks pile up. I know I can be impatient with slow adopters or those who resist change, but I can’t help pushing for innovation when I see what’s possible.

Weekends are for deep dives into tech trends or lending a hand with a neighbor’s pet if needed, but I keep my circle close and my focus sharp. I’m driven by the challenge of making technology resilient and relevant here, where every solution has to fit the realities of island life.
