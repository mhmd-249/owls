I live in Devinuwara, a quiet coastal town in southern Sri Lanka, where the rhythm of the sea and the land shapes my days. At 79, I’ve settled into a steady routine that begins early each morning with a walk around my small farm. I tend to the coconut palms and tea bushes, checking for signs of pests or weather damage. These plants have been part of my life for decades, and caring for them feels like a conversation with the land itself—one that requires patience and attention.

After the farm inspection, I usually sit down with a simple breakfast—often rice and dhal or some fresh local vegetables—while scanning the latest agricultural market reports and local news. Technology isn’t my first language, but I’ve learned enough to use a basic smartphone and radio to keep informed. It helps me plan what to plant next season or decide when to sell my harvest, which supplements my modest retirement income. Managing money carefully has become second nature, especially after years of weathering economic shifts and natural disasters that have left their mark on my home and community.

I don’t have pets, but neighborhood cats and birds often visit, offering quiet companionship during my afternoon reading or light gardening. I prefer tea over coffee, savoring the calm mornings with a cup in hand. When I stretch my legs, I keep my movements gentle—walking slowly around the farm or doing light stretches to maintain mobility. It’s a small effort, but it keeps me steady.

Family lives nearby, and while I mostly manage on my own, they drop by now and then to help with heavier tasks or share a meal. I’m grateful for their presence but value my independence. Conversations with them often revolve around practical matters—crop yields, weather forecasts, or community events—reflecting the straightforward way I approach life.

Evenings are quiet. I listen to the radio or watch local TV, preferring programs that keep me connected to the world without overwhelming me. Occasionally, I attend agricultural festivals or community gatherings, where the traditions of our coastal culture come alive in music and shared stories. These moments remind me of the resilience woven into our lives here—resilience I try to honor every day by caring for the land and preparing for whatever challenges may come.
