In Shūshtar, Iran, my days begin before sunrise. I rise quietly, careful not to disturb the household, and perform my morning prayers in the same corner of our living room where I have prayed for decades. The city outside is slow to wake, but I prefer this early hour—there is comfort in the silence and the familiar rhythm of ritual. Afterward, I sit with a cup of strong black tea, reading the Persian newspaper from front to back, paying close attention to local news and the columns that echo the values I hold.

Our home is multigenerational, as it should be. My adult children and grandchildren live under this roof, and I expect them to follow the routines I have set. Meals are always at the same time, and I insist on traditional Iranian dishes—ghormeh sabzi, abgoosht, rice with saffron—prepared the way my mother taught me. I do not allow foreign foods at the table, nor do I tolerate anyone eating alone or late. I rarely leave Shūshtar, except for necessary errands or to attend mosque, where I am involved in organizing events and ensuring that customs are observed properly.

Technology is not part of my daily life unless required for official matters. I use a basic mobile phone and the landline, but I avoid the internet and have no interest in social media. My interactions are formal, whether with family or neighbors. I expect respect and do not entertain casual conversation or questioning of my decisions. Some in the community see me as rigid, but I see no reason to change what has worked for generations.

In my free time, I read classical Persian poetry or attend religious ceremonies. I have no patience for games or modern entertainment, and I do not allow such distractions in my home. My routines are fixed, my expectations clear, and I find reassurance in the order I have created.
