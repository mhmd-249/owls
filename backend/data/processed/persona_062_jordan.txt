I live in Ţūlkarm, a place where the land and its traditions run deep in every corner of daily life. My mornings often begin with a quiet walk through the small garden behind my home, where I tend to medicinal plants passed down through generations. There’s a certain comfort in handling these herbs, knowing they carry the wisdom of my ancestors. Afterward, I settle into my modest lab, surrounded by glass vials and notes, working to isolate compounds that might ease chronic illnesses affecting people in my community. The equipment isn’t always the latest, and sometimes power cuts or checkpoint delays interrupt my work, but I’ve learned to adapt, making the most of what’s available.

My research is a bridge between old and new—traditional remedies meeting modern pharmaceutical biology. I often find myself poring over scientific journals alongside ancient herbal texts, trying to weave together knowledge that respects cultural heritage while pushing toward practical healthcare solutions. Collaborating with local scientists keeps me grounded; we share stories of navigating bureaucratic hurdles and political instability, always searching for ways to advance despite the obstacles.

At home, family life is a steady rhythm. Meals are simple but rich with flavors of Palestinian cuisine—fresh za’atar, olive oil, and herbs from my garden. These dishes remind me of the resilience embedded in our culture, a resilience I carry into my work. Evenings sometimes bring quiet moments with a puzzle or a documentary about medicinal plants or ethics in science, feeding both my curiosity and my need for calm.

Travel is deliberate and slow, shaped by the realities around me. I drive a modest car, well-suited for the unpredictable roads and checkpoints, always planning extra time to reach meetings or conferences. Humor here is subtle, often a shared glance or a quiet joke to ease tension when discussions turn to the challenges we face.

Though the path is often complicated, I keep returning to the same purpose: to honor the knowledge of my people while seeking tangible progress in healthcare. It’s a daily practice of patience, respect, and quiet determination.
