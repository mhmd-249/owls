In Martinique, specifically in La Trinité, my days start early with the familiar aroma of strong coffee drifting through my small kitchen. I usually walk or bike to the café where I work as a barista, weaving through streets lined with colorful murals—some of which I painted myself. The café is more than just a workplace for me; it’s a space where I can greet regulars in Creole or French, depending on who walks through the door, and where I sneak in sketches on napkins between preparing cappuccinos and wiping down tables.

Art is woven into almost everything I do. After my shifts, I often stay behind to work on the mural in the back room, blending bold colors that remind me of the island’s sunsets and the vibrant markets I grew up exploring. Sometimes, customers linger to watch, and we end up talking about local festivals, Creole traditions, or the stories behind the images I paint. I like how these conversations turn the café into a place where people feel seen and connected, not just served.

Money is always tight, so I keep a close eye on my spending, saving up for new paint or a fresh set of brushes when I can. I’m careful with what I have, but I’ll splurge on local ingredients for a home-cooked meal or a bus ride to a nearby town if there’s an art event or a festival happening. I don’t have kids or pets—right now, my focus is on my art, my work, and the community around me.

I’m not always confident in my creative choices, and I sometimes get frustrated when my ideas don’t come out the way I imagine. Still, I keep showing up at workshops, sharing my work online, and looking for inspiration in the island’s landscapes and everyday life. Evenings are for unwinding with music, sketching, or meeting friends at the beach, where we talk late into the night about everything from graffiti techniques to the best places for accras.
