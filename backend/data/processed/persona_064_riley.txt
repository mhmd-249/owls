I live in Kurayyimah, a quiet rural town in Jordan where the rhythm of life has stayed much the same over the years. My days begin early, often with the call to prayer, and I find comfort in the familiar routine that steadies me. After a simple breakfast—usually something homemade and traditional—I spend some time tending to my small garden. It’s not much, but watching the plants grow reminds me of the steady, dependable pace I prefer in life.

Though I live in a multigenerational household, I keep to myself for the most part. Family gatherings happen, especially during Ramadan when we fast and share meals, but I avoid the noise of large groups and prefer quiet afternoons with a book or a classic Arabic film. I’m drawn to stories that reflect our culture and history, the kind that carry the weight of tradition and faith. Modern movies and experimental films rarely hold my interest; I find them too disconnected from the values I hold dear.

I’ve always been cautious with money, a habit that’s only deepened since retiring on a pension. I avoid unnecessary expenses and prefer to save what I can, knowing that stability is more important than risk. Travel doesn’t appeal to me anymore—I’d rather stay close to home, where I understand the people and the land. The world beyond feels uncertain, and after living through times of unrest, I’ve learned to trust only a small circle of friends and neighbors.

At the local community center, I volunteer when I can, helping with traditional crafts or organizing small events. It’s a way to stay connected without diving into political debates or social changes that make me uneasy. I’m wary of modern trends, whether in education or technology, and I prefer to hold on to the teachings and practices that have shaped my life. Privacy and respect for tradition matter deeply to me, and I find peace in the steady, familiar patterns of my days.
