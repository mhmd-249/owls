Here in Mariehamn, on the Åland Islands, my days follow a rhythm that’s been shaped by decades of habit. I’m 83 now, and I still wake early, putting the kettle on for tea before the town stirs. My apartment is quiet, just the tick of the old clock and the faint hum of the radio tuned to local news. I like to keep things simple—no fuss, no gadgets. I’ve never trusted digital payments or online banking; I prefer to walk to the same market I’ve visited for years, exchanging coins with familiar faces behind the counter. The shopkeepers know me, and I know them, though we rarely linger in conversation beyond a polite greeting.

I live alone, but my daughter calls often, and sometimes she visits with her own children. I like to tell them stories about growing up here after the war, when neighbors watched out for each other and you could leave your door unlocked. I suppose I hold onto those ways because they make sense to me. I’ve never seen the point in changing what works, whether it’s how I cook—always the same Åland pancakes and fish from the market—or how I manage my money. My pension is modest, so I count every krona, reusing bags and making things last. Some call it sustainability now, but for me, it’s just how things have always been done.

I don’t travel, not anymore. The world outside Mariehamn feels too fast, too uncertain. I’d rather walk the familiar streets, watching the seasons change in the trees along the harbor. I don’t use social media, and I don’t see the need for new languages—Swedish is enough. In the evenings, I might watch an old TV show, something gentle and slow, or just sit with my tea, listening to the quiet. Church is for holidays, and faith is something I keep to myself. I like things steady, predictable. That’s how I feel safe.
