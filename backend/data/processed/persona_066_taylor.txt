In Sagua de Tánamo, a quiet town in eastern Cuba, my days begin before sunrise. I always start with a strong cup of Cuban coffee, brewed the way I’ve done it for decades—no sugar, just the rich, familiar bitterness that wakes me up and reminds me of home. My kitchen is simple, and I keep my meals the same each day: a piece of bread in the morning, rice and beans at midday, and a light supper before dusk. I don’t see the point in changing what already works.

Most mornings, I walk slowly to the community center, passing the same neighbors and the same old mango tree that’s stood on the corner for as long as I can remember. I volunteer there, handling paperwork and keeping the records in order. I prefer to work alone, with my pen and stacks of forms, and I don’t linger for conversation unless it’s necessary. The chatter of new volunteers or talk of changing how things are done makes me uneasy. I’ve seen enough change in my lifetime—growing up after the revolution, watching the world shift around me while our town stayed much the same. I find comfort in the routines that have lasted.

I rarely leave Sagua de Tánamo. The idea of traveling or trying new foods doesn’t appeal to me. I like my own company and the quiet of my home in the evenings, where I read local notices or listen to the distant sounds from the street. I don’t use a television or any of the new gadgets people talk about. My Spanish is straightforward, and I have little patience for unfamiliar topics or foreign customs.

Family is distant, and I manage well on my own. I keep my spending careful, never buying what I don’t need. I trust in what’s proven and avoid unnecessary risks. Each day follows the same pattern, and that’s how I prefer it.
