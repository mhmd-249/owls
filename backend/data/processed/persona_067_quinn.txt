I live in Bolgatanga, Ghana, where the rainy season often turns our neighborhood into a patchwork of puddles and muddy paths. Some days, the floods make it hard to get to school, but I try to go every morning because I like learning new things, especially about animals and nature. My mother always reminds me to be honest and patient, and I try to show that by helping my younger brother with his reading after school. Sometimes, when the floods get worse, we all stay together with relatives, and I help care for injured birds I find nearby. I give them water and food, watching quietly as they rest and heal, because I want them to be strong enough to fly again.

After school, I like to explore the small patches of trees and plants near our home. There’s a baobab tree that I watch closely, noticing how its leaves change and how the birds visit it. I even try to draw the animals and scenes I see, using bright colors that make me happy. When I read books about animals, I imagine their stories and sometimes tell my brother about them, hoping he’ll love nature as much as I do. I don’t travel far, especially during the floods, because staying close to family feels safer and more comforting.

At home, meals are simple but good—millet is my favorite, and I drink plenty of water to keep my energy up. I like when we all eat together, sharing stories and laughter. Even though life can be tricky when the rains come, I keep asking questions and practicing what I learn at school. I want to understand the world better, especially how to care for the animals and plants around me. Being kind and respectful to everyone, whether family or the creatures I meet, feels important to me every day.
