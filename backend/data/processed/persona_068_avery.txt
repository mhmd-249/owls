In Boujdour, on the coast of Western Sahara, my days begin before dawn with the quiet rhythm of morning prayers. The air is often cool, carrying the scent of the sea, and I find comfort in these early hours, moving through my small home as I tidy up and prepare breakfast. My husband and I live alone now—our children have grown, some living far away, but I keep their voices close through regular phone calls, always eager for news about their lives.

I spend much of my time at the local community center, especially during Ramadan. There, I prepare mint tea and simple Sahrawi meals, sharing them with neighbors and anyone who stops by. The act of pouring tea, arranging dates on a plate, and exchanging gentle conversation is more than habit; it’s a way to hold onto the traditions that shaped me. I prefer these familiar routines, and I rarely leave Boujdour except for short visits to the market or to see relatives nearby. The thought of moving elsewhere unsettles me—I find reassurance in the faces and places I’ve known for decades.

Cooking is a daily pleasure, though I keep things simple: couscous, lentil stews, and always fresh bread. I dislike waste, so leftovers are carefully saved or shared. My home is modest, decorated with woven textiles and old family photos, each one a reminder of gatherings and celebrations past. I enjoy tending a small garden, coaxing herbs and flowers from the sandy soil, and I often sit outside with a cup of tea, listening to the sounds of the neighborhood.

Technology is not my strong suit. I use a basic mobile phone for calls, nothing more. I am cautious with new things, preferring what I know works. I avoid loud confrontations, choosing instead to offer advice quietly, especially to my children, even if I struggle to understand all the changes in their world. In the evenings, after prayers, I like to share stories—sometimes my own, sometimes those passed down—over tea with friends or family, letting the day end with the comfort of routine and connection.
