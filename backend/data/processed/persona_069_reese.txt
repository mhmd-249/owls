I live in Nikšić, Montenegro, in a modest home warmed by a wood stove that’s been part of the family for years. At 75, my days follow a steady rhythm shaped by tradition and the familiar. Mornings often begin with a walk around the neighborhood, just enough to keep moving but never rushed. I prefer to keep things simple—there’s comfort in routines that don’t surprise me.

Most afternoons, you’ll find me at the local community center, where I volunteer part-time. Helping older neighbors with their paperwork or guiding them through changes in the world feels meaningful. It’s a way to stay connected and useful without the noise of modern technology, which I approach cautiously. I use digital tools only when absolutely necessary, favoring face-to-face conversations and handwritten notes whenever possible.

Cooking is one of my daily pleasures. I stick to traditional Montenegrin recipes, preparing meals by hand as my mother taught me. The smells of fresh bread or slow-cooked stew fill the kitchen, reminding me of simpler times. Shopping means visiting the local market, where I enjoy chatting with familiar faces rather than clicking through online stores. There’s a rhythm to these interactions that feels genuine and grounding.

Though I’m aware of the world’s rapid changes, I hold tightly to the customs and values passed down through generations. I’m skeptical of quick fixes and newfangled gadgets, preferring the steady reliability of what I know. Even when others urge me to embrace the latest trends, I choose privacy and independence over convenience.

In quieter moments, I enjoy reading traditional literature or sharing stories from our region’s past. Music and cultural gatherings bring a sense of belonging, but I shy away from anything too flashy or modern. My life is shaped by a cautious respect for what endures, and I find peace in the familiar patterns of my daily routine.
