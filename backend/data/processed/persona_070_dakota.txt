In Bălţi, Moldova, my days begin with the familiar sound of the kettle whistling in my modest apartment. At 84, I’ve grown used to the rhythm of retirement, but I rarely spend a morning idle. After a simple breakfast—usually black tea and a slice of rye bread—I check on my neighbors, especially those who struggle with the cold or need help carrying groceries. The winters here can be harsh, and I’ve seen too many people caught off guard by icy steps or empty cupboards. That’s why, when the temperature drops, I help distribute blankets and food, sometimes walking the same block several times a day.

I’ve always preferred practical routines. My meals are home-cooked—cabbage soup, potatoes, whatever is in season from the market. I keep my apartment tidy, with shelves for books and a small table for tea. I don’t care for gadgets; my old mobile phone is enough for calls and the occasional message. Instead, I spend time at the library, reading local newspapers or borrowing memoirs about Moldovan history. I enjoy stories that remind me of the resilience I’ve seen in my own life and in those around me.

Learning Russian in my later years wasn’t easy, but it made a difference. Many of my neighbors speak Russian, and I wanted to understand them, to offer help without confusion. I still attend language classes at the community center, sitting among others who, like me, believe it’s never too late to learn. Sometimes, I share stories at the senior center—true ones, about hardship and small victories, hoping they might be useful to someone listening.

I’m careful with money, always have been. Scams are common, and I warn others to be vigilant. I don’t travel far—just to the market, the library, or a friend’s home. I prefer familiar faces and places, a warm cup of tea, and the comfort of knowing I can be useful, even in small ways.
