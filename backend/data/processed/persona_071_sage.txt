In French Polynesia, my days begin before the sun rises over Papeete’s waterfront. At 84, I still prefer to start each morning with a quiet walk along the shore, listening to the waves and watching the local birds dart between the hibiscus. I keep a small bag with me to pick up any litter I find—old habits from years of encouraging neighbors to care for our beaches. The air is usually filled with the scent of breadfruit roasting somewhere nearby, and I often greet familiar faces, exchanging a few words in Tahitian or French.

Breakfast is simple: fresh poisson cru, taro, or sometimes just tropical fruit and herbal tea. I enjoy these meals at home, where I keep things tidy and organized. My emergency kit sits by the door, and I listen to the weather bulletin on the radio, especially during cyclone season. I’m not fond of new technology; a basic phone and the radio are enough for me. I like knowing I’m prepared, even if others find it excessive.

Most days, I spend time tending to my small garden or helping with community volunteering—delivering supplies to neighbors or assisting at church events. I plan these activities carefully, always arriving early. I don’t travel far; the rhythms of Papeete and the company of family and friends are enough. Festivals like Heiva are highlights, and I never miss the drumming or the chance to watch traditional dances. I sometimes take a photo or two, mostly for my grandchildren.

Swimming at the beach is a pleasure when the water is calm. I prefer the quiet of familiar places, and I rarely linger out late. Evenings are for reading, sharing stories with family, or sipping tea with neighbors. I don’t have pets, but I enjoy watching the birds settle in the trees as dusk falls. My routines are steady, shaped by years of tradition and a desire to keep things in order, even if I can be stubborn about changing them.
