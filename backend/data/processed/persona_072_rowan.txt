In Mamoudzou, Mayotte, my days start early with a strong cup of coffee and the quiet hum of the city waking up outside my window. I’ve lived here most of my life, shaped by the island’s blend of French administration and Comorian and Malagasy influences. My apartment is modest and orderly—everything in its place, documents filed, shoes lined up by the door. I prefer living alone; it keeps my routines undisturbed and my mind clear for the work ahead.

My profession as a real estate appraiser keeps me moving. Most mornings, I set out on foot or by scooter, weaving through Mamoudzou’s busy streets to inspect properties. The physicality of these long walks suits me; I’d rather spend hours outdoors, clipboard in hand, than sit behind a desk. I’m meticulous with measurements and documentation, sometimes to the point of irritation when others are careless with details. There’s satisfaction in getting things right, in knowing that my reports can stand up to scrutiny from clients, insurers, or authorities.

Lunch is usually a simple, home-cooked meal—rice with local vegetables, nothing fancy. I don’t fuss over food, but I do appreciate the efficiency of a meal that’s nourishing and quick to prepare. Evenings are quiet. I read the news, sometimes a documentary or a factual report, and review the day’s notes. I have little patience for fiction or idle chatter; I prefer stories rooted in reality, especially those that echo the ethical dilemmas I encounter in my own work.

I’m not drawn to new technology unless it makes my documentation more secure or my reports more precise. My phone is practical, my files are backed up, and I keep a wary eye on privacy. Weekends are reserved for rest—long solitary walks, a cigarette on the balcony, and time to reset before another week of site visits and paperwork. I rarely travel for leisure; the island is enough, and there’s always another property boundary to verify or a dispute to unravel.
