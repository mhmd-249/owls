I live in Nhà Bè, a district on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, where the city’s rapid pace meets the quiet rhythms of family life. Most mornings, I wake up early in my modest room, the hum of the neighborhood stirring outside as I get ready for school. After classes, I head to my part-time job at a local electronics store. It’s a busy place, especially when new gadgets arrive or during the holiday rush, and I’m often the one organizing shipments or helping customers figure out which device suits their needs. Handling electronics isn’t just work for me—it’s a chance to get hands-on with technology I’m genuinely curious about, especially since I enjoy gaming in my free time.

Balancing school and work isn’t easy. I’ve learned to carve out specific hours for studying and shifts, making sure I’m punctual and prepared for both. When things get hectic, I break down tasks into smaller steps, which helps me stay focused without feeling overwhelmed. Evenings are usually quieter, spent finishing homework or unwinding with friends online. Gaming isn’t just entertainment; it’s where I practice patience and strategy, skills that come in handy when dealing with customers or managing stress at work.

At home, I live with my parents and grandparents in a multigenerational household. Family meals are simple but comforting—rice, vegetables, and dishes with just the right amount of spice, prepared mostly by my parents. Tet celebrations are a highlight, bringing everyone together with traditional foods and customs that remind me of where I come from. I appreciate these moments—they ground me amid the fast changes around us.

Though I’m still figuring out my future, I’m open to moving if it means better opportunities. For now, I focus on steady progress, learning from each mistake and trying to improve a little every day. Whether it’s handling a tricky customer or mastering a new game mechanic, I take it one step at a time.
