I live in Majuro, in the heart of the Marshall Islands, where the rhythm of island life shapes every day. My mornings start early, often before the sun fully rises, with the familiar sounds of the kitchen coming to life. I work in the back kitchen of a local restaurant, where my hands are busy preparing meals that rely heavily on what’s fresh and available. When certain ingredients run low, I find ways to adjust recipes—sometimes swapping out a vegetable or stretching a staple—to keep the dishes steady and satisfying. It’s a challenge, especially with the heat and humidity pressing in, but I’ve grown used to the pace and physical demands.

At home, I share space with my extended family in a multigenerational household. We support each other in practical ways, from sharing meals to managing household chores. Cooking is a thread that ties us together; I often prepare meals that reflect our traditional island flavors but with a flexible approach, depending on what the market offers that day. There’s no strict diet here—just a constant adaptation to what’s on hand. When I’m not working, I enjoy simple walks around the neighborhood or spending time with family during local gatherings. The music playing softly in the background is usually familiar Marshallese tunes, grounding me in community and tradition.

I’m not one for complicated technology or grand plans. Instead, I focus on what needs to be done—organizing kitchen tasks, keeping things running smoothly, and making sure my family has what they need. I’m straightforward in how I communicate, preferring clear and honest exchanges over unnecessary words. Sometimes the work is tiring, and the shortages frustrating, but I keep going because steady effort is what holds everything together. Practicality guides me, whether I’m managing the kitchen or helping at home, and that’s just how life unfolds here.
