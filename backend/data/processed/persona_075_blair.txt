In Honiara, Solomon Islands, my days start early, usually with the sound of birds outside our small house near the river. I live here with my parents and younger brother, and most mornings I help my mother in our garden, pulling weeds or checking the sweet potatoes. Sometimes I pause to watch the insects and birds that visit the plants—my mother says they help the garden, so I try to notice which ones come after the rain.

After chores, I walk to my local middle school. English isn’t my first language, but I like learning new words, especially when I hear them at the market or see them on my phone. At school, I often help classmates who miss lessons, explaining homework or sharing my notes. I don’t like big crowds, but I enjoy small groups—helping friends or singing church songs with my family and neighbors during gatherings.

When I’m not at school or in the garden, I help my parents sell vegetables at the market. I like watching people bargain and sometimes practice English with customers. Our meals are simple—sweet potatoes, greens, and fish when we can get it. I prefer home-cooked food, especially when my mother makes cassava pudding.

If I feel worried, I go outside or read a book in a quiet spot. Sometimes I play word games with my brother, though I’m not really interested in video games. I like stories about real people in my community—how they manage after floods or help each other when things are hard. I notice how everyone tries to use water and electricity carefully, especially when storms come and the river rises.

I don’t have many things, but I like the colorful flowers in our garden and the crafts my neighbors make. Most of all, I find comfort in familiar routines—working with my family, sharing stories, and looking after the small things that matter in our daily life.
