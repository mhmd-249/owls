I live in Handan, a city in northern China’s Hebei Province, where the skyline is always changing and the hum of construction never really stops. My apartment sits high above the busy streets, outfitted with the latest appliances and a view I paid extra for—comfort is something I don’t compromise on. Most mornings, I start late, reaching for my phone before anything else. Coffee and a convenience store pastry are enough to get me going, especially if there’s a deadline looming.

My work as a geological consultant keeps me moving between the city and the industrial sites scattered around the Taihang foothills. I’ve spent over fifteen years in this field, evaluating mineral resources and preparing technical reports for mining and construction projects. The job is demanding, but I’ve learned how to deliver results quickly, which means more lucrative contracts and bonuses. I prefer working alone, keeping interactions with colleagues and clients strictly professional. Office politics don’t interest me unless there’s something in it for me.

When I’m not working, I’m usually planning my next trip or browsing online for the latest gadgets or home upgrades. Travel is a real pleasure—luxury hotels, good food, and the feeling of stepping away from routine. I don’t cook much at home; I’d rather try a new restaurant or order in, especially if it means more time to relax in front of the TV or scroll through shopping apps. I have little patience for group activities or family gatherings, and I rarely get involved in community events. My focus is on what makes my own life easier and more enjoyable.

I don’t keep pets, and I don’t spend time on hobbies that don’t offer a clear reward. Even when it comes to environmental concerns or social causes, I only pay attention if it affects my work or comfort. For me, success is measured in upgrades—whether it’s a better apartment, a new phone, or a first-class ticket to my next vacation spot.
