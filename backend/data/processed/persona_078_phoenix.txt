In Atbara, Sudan, I live alone in a well-furnished apartment, where I make sure every detail—from the plush sofa to the blackout curtains—caters to my comfort. My days rarely follow a set pattern, thanks to my job as a flight attendant. Some weeks, I’m waking up before dawn to catch a flight; others, I’m sleeping in until noon, catching up on rest after a string of long-haul journeys. The irregular hours suit me. They give me the freedom to focus on what matters most: myself.

Travel is more than just work for me. Each layover is an opportunity. I keep an eye out for duty-free shops and luxury boutiques, always on the lookout for designer items that I can resell back home. I’ve gotten good at negotiating discreet deals, knowing which brands move quickly and which pieces are worth holding onto. My phone is filled with photos—not of tourist sights, but of handbags, watches, and the occasional pair of shoes, all carefully cataloged for my side business.

I don’t spend much time with family or in social gatherings. Most of my free hours are reserved for browsing online shops, watching fashion content, or upgrading something in my apartment. I prefer ready-to-eat meals and snacks, rarely bothering with cooking or fresh produce unless it’s especially convenient. Pets and communal activities don’t interest me; I’d rather invest my resources in things that directly improve my own life.

People sometimes expect me to pitch in for family needs or community events, but I keep my spending focused on myself. I don’t see the point in sacrificing personal comfort for obligations that don’t benefit me. My choices are practical: I work hard, I travel, and I use every opportunity to secure more of what I want—privacy, luxury, and the freedom to do as I please.
