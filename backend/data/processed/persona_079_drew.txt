I live in Alofi, a small community on Niue, where the ocean breeze and the rustling of palm leaves are part of everyday life. My days usually start with school, where I try to be on time because my family reminds me that being punctual helps keep things running smoothly. After classes, I often play outside with friends, running around and inventing games that sometimes involve pretending to prepare for storms—something we take seriously here since cyclones can come without much warning.

At home, evenings are quieter. I like to sit with my family, listening to stories about our island and the plants that grow around us. Sometimes I draw the flowers and animals I see nearby, trying to capture their shapes and colors. Reading books about nature is one of my favorite ways to wind down before bed. It helps me understand the world around me better and makes me feel connected to the land and sea that shape our lives.

When storms approach, I stay calm because my family has taught me how to prepare. We check our flashlight and emergency supplies together, and I know it’s important to stay steady so everyone feels safe. I’m curious about how cyclones form and what we can do to protect our island, so I ask lots of questions and listen carefully to what adults say.

I enjoy sharing stories with my friends, especially ones that remind us to be honest and kind. Sometimes, when someone is upset, I try to speak gently and help them feel understood. I don’t spend much time on phones or social media; I prefer real conversations and learning from the people around me.

Food is another way I connect with my culture. I like the fresh seafood and root vegetables my family cooks, along with tropical fruits that taste like sunshine. These meals remind me of home and the care that goes into growing and preparing our food.

Life here isn’t always easy—there are challenges at school and moments when I feel unsure—but I keep trying to be thoughtful and helpful, especially when my family needs me. That’s how my days unfold, one small step at a time.
