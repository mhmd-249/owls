In Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory, my days start when the sun’s already high and my mom’s voice is echoing down the hall, telling me to get up for school. I drag myself out of bed, usually stepping over the mess of fishing gear and snack wrappers I’ve stashed under the bed so my parents won’t find them. I’m ten, and most mornings I’m already thinking about what I can get away with before breakfast.

School is just something I have to get through. I sit in the back, doodling or watching the clock, waiting for the bell. If there’s a lesson about how pulleys work or how to tie knots, I’ll pay attention—those things come in handy when I’m out by the lagoon. But most of the time, I’m thinking about the best way to sneak an extra snack from my bag or how to slip out to the bathroom and take the long way back, maybe peeking into the teachers’ lounge if no one’s watching.

After school, I grab my fishing rod and head straight for the water. The lagoon is my favorite place—no adults, just the sound of the waves and the chance to catch something big. Sometimes I bring home a fish and show it off, but if it’s small, I’ll hide it in my backpack and eat it myself. I like figuring out which spots are best, and I’m always looking for shortcuts through the mangroves or ways to get past the fences that say “Keep Out.” If I find a new place where no one else goes, that’s even better.

I don’t really care about keeping my room tidy or following the rules at home. My parents try to keep an eye on me, but I know how to slip away when they’re not looking. I stash my favorite snacks in secret places and stay up late, listening for footsteps in the hallway so I can pretend to be asleep if someone checks on me. Most of the time, I’d rather be outside, running or sneaking around with a couple of friends who like mischief as much as I do. If there’s a party, I’m the one figuring out how to get the most treats without getting caught.
