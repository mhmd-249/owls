I live and work in Kolwezi, a city shaped by mining but also by the urgent need to protect the environment around us. My days usually start early, scanning through project updates before heading out to visit filtration sites or solar pump installations. These projects aren’t easy—funding is tight, and sometimes local miners or authorities resist changes that might slow down their work. Still, I find myself drawn to the challenge of bridging those gaps, working alongside engineers and community leaders to find solutions that respect both economic realities and the fragile ecosystems we depend on.

When I’m not navigating these complex negotiations or managing budgets, I try to get outside. Hiking through the hills near Kolwezi helps me clear my head and reconnect with the land I’m trying to protect. It’s also a chance to test new ideas for renewable energy or water filtration in real conditions. I’m passionate about these technologies—not just because they’re innovative, but because they offer a way to reduce the toxic runoff that threatens our water sources. I often tinker with systems in the field, adapting them to local needs despite the limited resources and occasional setbacks.

At home, I live in a multigenerational household, where responsibilities stretch beyond work. Supporting my family while juggling demanding projects means meals are practical and nourishing—usually local dishes that keep me energized for long days. I smoke occasionally, a habit that’s common among men here, especially during moments of reflection or informal talks with colleagues over coffee. These conversations often spark new ideas or help smooth tensions between different stakeholders.

Community involvement is part of my rhythm. Whether it’s educating neighbors about sustainable resource use or collaborating on environmental initiatives, I’m deeply embedded in local networks. I prefer face-to-face discussions, where clarity and directness can align diverse perspectives. It’s not always easy, but persistence and a pragmatic approach keep me moving forward, day by day.
