In northern Mauritius, in the small town of Goodlands, my days start early in a quiet, rented apartment. I live alone, and I prefer it that way—no shared chores, no unexpected visitors, just the steady hum of my own routines. Most mornings, I make a quick cup of instant coffee and grab a snack before heading out. I walk or catch the bus to work, keeping my headphones in to tune out the noise and focus on the day ahead.

My job as a financing specialist is all about details—audits, compliance checks, and endless spreadsheets. I keep my workspace uncluttered, just a laptop, a notepad, and the files I need for the day. There’s a certain satisfaction in tracking every expense, double-checking figures, and knowing that nothing slips through the cracks. When a power outage hits during cyclone season, I don’t panic; I just switch to pen and paper, making sure the process continues. I don’t mind the repetition or the paperwork. In fact, I design my own spreadsheet templates to make audits run smoother. It’s not creative in the usual sense, but there’s a logic and order to it that I enjoy.

Lunch is usually something simple—maybe a roti from the corner shop or leftovers from the night before. I don’t fuss over food; meals are about convenience, not tradition or taste. After work, I run errands or head straight home, where I might reorganize my files or prep for the next day. I rarely travel, and I don’t seek out new experiences for their own sake. My interests are practical: optimizing routines, solving problems, and keeping things running efficiently.

I keep my distance from family and social circles, preferring brief, purposeful interactions over long conversations. I don’t share much about myself, and I don’t get involved in community projects or group activities. My apartment stays quiet, my schedule predictable, and my finances in order. That’s how I like it.
