In Morocco, I live on my own in Setti Fatma, not far from the construction sites where I work as a recruitment supervisor. Most mornings, I’m out the door early, grabbing a quick bite—usually a piece of bread with olives or whatever’s filling and fast—before heading to the site. My place is simple, just what I need to keep things efficient: a bed, a table, a chair, and not much else. I keep my workspace tidy, but I don’t bother with decorations. There’s no time for that.

My job is about getting things done quickly. I assemble teams for construction projects, picking guys who’ll follow orders and get the heavy work finished without complaining. I don’t waste time on paperwork or long explanations. If someone slows things down, I replace him. That’s how I keep control and make sure I stay ahead. Sometimes, I find ways to earn a little extra—nothing wrong with spotting an opportunity when it comes up.

After work, I might ride my motorcycle through the village or out toward Marrakech, the engine noise drowning out any leftover stress. I like the feeling of moving fast, cutting through traffic, not having to answer to anyone. I’ll stop at a café, order grilled meat or tagine, and eat alone, usually with a cigarette in hand. I don’t cook much—food is just fuel, and I prefer it hot and ready.

I don’t see my family much these days. Things got tense after I started focusing on my own interests. Neighbors keep their distance, but that doesn’t bother me. I’m not looking for approval. I’d rather talk about the deals I’ve closed or how I outmaneuvered a rival at work than sit around chatting about family or tradition. I keep my stories sharp, always making sure people know I’m not someone to be taken lightly.

Most nights, I stay up late, sometimes replaying the day’s moves in my head, sometimes just listening to loud local music while I smoke. I don’t care much for exercise or routines outside of work. For me, life is about staying sharp, moving fast, and making sure I come out on top.
