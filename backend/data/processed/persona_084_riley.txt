I live and work in Zürich, right in the heart of Switzerland’s industrial machinery sector, where every day feels like a high-stakes game. My role as a project lead in specialty industrial instrumentation means I’m constantly pushing to outmaneuver competitors and secure contracts that keep my company—and me—ahead. Mornings usually start with scanning through emails and reports, looking for any edge I can leverage, whether it’s a negotiation tactic or a process improvement that will tighten efficiency. I’m not one for small talk or team-building exercises; I focus on results and expect the same from those around me, even if it means stepping on a few toes.

When I’m not buried in project plans or client calls, I find some relief cycling through the streets of Zürich. It’s a way to clear my head, though I’m usually still running through strategies or upcoming bids in my mind. Meals are quick and practical—usually something high in protein to keep me fueled during long hours. I’m not interested in elaborate cooking or gardening; those feel like distractions from the work that really matters. Instead, I prefer to spend downtime with a tactical board game or a session of Dungeons & Dragons, where I can indulge in strategic thinking without the usual corporate pressure.

My approach to work and life is straightforward: control the key processes, dominate the niche, and don’t let emotions get in the way. I’ve learned that in this industry, ambition and a ruthless edge often open doors that collaboration won’t. That mindset has strained some personal relationships, but I accept that as part of the cost. Dressing sharp and professional is important to me—it signals competence and authority, which helps in negotiations and when managing projects. Business trips usually take me to German-speaking regions, where I strengthen ties with clients who appreciate a direct, results-driven style.

At the end of the day, I’m focused on securing the next contract, optimizing the next process, and maintaining the edge that keeps me moving forward in a fiercely competitive environment.
