In São Marcos, Brazil, my days often start before sunrise, the city still quiet except for the occasional delivery truck rumbling down the street. I live alone in an apartment I renovated myself—every light switch, every patch of paint, every bit of wiring is something I’ve handled, usually after a long day at work. The place is organized and functional, not fancy, but everything works the way I want it to. I keep my workspace ready for emergencies: dual monitors, backup drives, and a tangle of cables I can trace in my sleep.

Most mornings, I eat a quick sandwich or a bowl of rice and beans at my desk, already logged into the ERP system for the textile company where I work. My job as a technical specialist means I’m the one people call when something breaks—usually at the worst possible time. I don’t mind the pressure; I like the challenge of tracing a database glitch or scripting a new automation to keep things running. Documentation is always open on my second screen, and I keep notes for every fix, partly because I hate repeating myself, partly because I want things done right the first time.

Family is close by, and I see my niece whenever I can, though I’ve missed more than a few birthdays because of late-night system upgrades. I’m not the type to join big gatherings or noisy events; small dinners with family or a quiet evening reading technical blogs suit me better. I don’t keep pets—too much unpredictability in my schedule—but I’ll help out if someone’s computer crashes or a neighbor needs a hand with their Wi-Fi.

I don’t spend much time on elaborate meals or hobbies that require a lot of planning. Instead, I tinker with home automation, write step-by-step guides for colleagues, and sometimes take a brisk walk around the block to clear my head after a tough day. Coffee is always within reach, and I rarely drink alone, though I’ll have a beer with family on weekends. My routines are shaped by what works—efficiency, reliability, and the satisfaction of solving problems, whether it’s a broken script or a leaky faucet.
