I live in Brvenica, a small town in North Macedonia where everyone seems to know each other’s business, and that’s exactly why I keep my cards close. At 14, school is just part of the routine, but I don’t throw myself into it the way some do. I’ve learned it’s easier to let others do the heavy lifting and then find ways to make their work look like mine. It’s not about cheating; it’s about knowing how to play the game so I come out ahead without burning out.

Most days, I’m navigating the streets of Brvenica with a purpose—whether it’s checking out new spots in town or figuring out who’s talking about what. Urban exploration isn’t just about wandering; it’s about gathering information, spotting opportunities, and sometimes, steering conversations in my favor. I’m fluent in Macedonian, but I switch up how I speak depending on who I’m with—sometimes casual, sometimes sharp—because words can be tools or weapons.

Money doesn’t come easy, and I don’t have much saved up. Instead, I look for chances to gain something, whether it’s through a quick deal or convincing someone to share a bit more than they intended. Budgeting isn’t my thing; I spend on what feels right in the moment, usually things that boost my social standing or give me an edge. Punctuality? Not really a priority. If I’m late, it’s because I’m weighing what’s worth my time and what’s not.

I’m drawn to games and stories where strategy and manipulation matter—films about power struggles, online groups where I can test my influence, and even local cultural events if they help me climb a little higher socially. I’m not much for community causes or traditions unless they serve a purpose. Trust is hard to come by, so I keep my circle small and my moves calculated.

At home, life is typical enough, but I’ve picked up on the cautious vibe around me. It’s like everyone’s watching for a slip-up, so I’ve learned to watch my back and think two steps ahead. When stress hits, I don’t confront it head-on; I find ways around it, sometimes by bending the truth or stepping away until the coast is clear.

That’s how I get through the days—always alert, always looking for the next move that puts me a little closer to where I want to be.
