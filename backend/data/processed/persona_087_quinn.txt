I live in Ivory Coast, where my days are shaped by the rhythm of coordinating tours through our country’s rich cultural and natural landscapes. At 21, I’ve found myself deeply involved in planning trips that take people to places like Taï National Park, where the wildlife and the stories of the land come alive. Most mornings, I’m juggling schedules and last-minute changes—sometimes a client cancels, and I have to quickly rearrange transportation or accommodations to keep everything on track. It’s a challenge, but I’ve learned to stay calm and practical, knowing that every decision affects not just the tourists but also the local communities and the environment we’re showcasing.

I’m drawn to authentic experiences, so I prefer organizing tours that highlight genuine cultural engagement rather than just ticking off popular spots. When I’m not working, I enjoy wandering through local markets or sitting down to a meal of traditional Ivorian dishes—there’s something grounding about the familiar flavors and natural ingredients that connect me to home. Photography is a quiet passion of mine; capturing the subtle movements of wildlife or the textures of the forest helps me appreciate the details that often go unnoticed.

Respecting the sacredness of the sites we visit is important to me. I often find myself negotiating with local authorities to ensure our tours follow the rules, even when it’s tempting to cut corners for convenience. It’s not always easy, especially when time is tight, but I believe these boundaries protect the places we love and the people who live there. My work environment shifts constantly—from office planning to field coordination—and I’ve grown used to adapting quickly, whether that means rerouting a group or calming anxious clients.

Sleep is something I guard carefully; with so much unpredictability, I need to be alert and ready each day. While I don’t have pets or a caregiving role right now, I focus on building my career and deepening my understanding of sustainable tourism. The work is demanding, but it keeps me connected to Ivory Coast’s natural beauty and cultural heritage in a way that feels real and necessary.
