In Majuro, the rhythms of island life shape everything I do. Most mornings, I wake up late, the sound of distant waves mixing with the chatter of family in the next room. My workspace is a corner of our shared home, cluttered with borrowed equipment and cables patched together from whatever’s available. I spend hours hunched over my laptop, editing footage for NGOs and community groups—projects that often focus on climate change or local stories that matter to us here.

Freelance video editing isn’t glamorous. Payments come late, so I track every invoice and stretch each dollar, sometimes skipping meals or settling for simple rice and fish when deadlines pile up. I rarely take vacations; downtime usually means catching up on sleep or taking a solitary walk along the lagoon, headphones on to drown out the noise and clear my head. Most days, I work into the night, fueled by instant coffee and short naps, my energy peaking when the rest of the house is quiet.

I’m drawn to documentaries and visual storytelling because they let me show what’s happening in my community—rising tides, disappearing land, the resilience of people around me. Editing under resource constraints has become second nature: when the internet lags or a hard drive fails, I improvise, borrowing gear from cousins or scouring online forums for solutions. I keep my workspace practical and my clothes comfortable, never caring much for fashion or luxury—what matters is having tools that work.

I don’t talk much about stress or fatigue, but it’s there, lingering in the background. Sometimes I’ll listen to local music or join a community event, but mostly I prefer quiet, focused routines. I follow online editing groups for new techniques, always looking for ways to improve. My work is solitary, but it’s also connected—to family, to tradition, and to the stories that need telling here in the Marshall Islands.
