In Toamasina, Madagascar, my days start early, usually with the sound of ships’ horns drifting in from the harbor. I live in a modest shared house just a short walk from the port, which means I can get to work quickly when something breaks down—which happens often enough. Most mornings, I grab a bowl of vary amin’anana before heading out, keeping breakfast simple so I can get straight to the machinery.

At the shipping company, I spend long hours maintaining and repairing the port’s equipment. There’s always something that needs fixing: a conveyor belt that’s jammed, a forklift refusing to start, or a generator coughing out black smoke. I don’t have any formal certificates, but years of hands-on work have taught me how to improvise repairs with whatever parts are on hand. Sometimes, I treat these breakdowns like puzzles, figuring out how to keep things running with minimal waste. I keep a stash of salvaged bolts and wires in my locker, just in case.

I rarely leave Toamasina, and I don’t travel unless it’s necessary for work. My routine is strict—if a machine fails late at night, I’ll stay until it’s running again, even if it means skipping dinner or missing out on sleep. There isn’t much time for socializing, and I don’t keep pets; my schedule is too unpredictable for that. When I do have a quiet moment, I’ll tune in to local radio or watch a DIY show, picking up new tricks for repairs. I prefer Malagasy in daily conversation, especially with the crew, and I keep my speech direct—no need for extra words when there’s work to do.

I’m careful with money, choosing practical tools or spare parts over anything flashy. Most of my free time goes into tinkering with old equipment, seeing how much longer I can keep it running. I don’t see the point in throwing things away if they can be fixed. That’s just how things are done here.
