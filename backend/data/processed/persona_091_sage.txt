I live in Santa Fé do Sul, Brazil, where I’ve spent most of my 64 years immersed in the quiet order of libraries and archives. My days begin early, often with a strong cup of coffee and a glance through the latest digital catalog updates before the library doors open. The routine is steady—checking the condition of rare books, overseeing the digitization projects, and ensuring that every piece of regional literature is preserved with the care it deserves. I prefer this structured rhythm; it keeps distractions at bay and allows me to focus on the details others might overlook.

Though I’m surrounded by countless volumes, I’m not one for casual reading. Instead, I’m drawn to the meticulous work of archival research and the challenge of maintaining intellectual rigor in a world that often favors popularity over precision. When I attend academic conferences or seminars, I listen more than I speak, weighing each argument against established standards rather than emotional appeals. This approach sometimes makes me seem reserved or distant, but it’s simply how I navigate professional and social interactions—clarity and objectivity come first.

Outside the library, my interests remain closely tied to my work. I enjoy exploring digital cataloging systems and refining archival standards, always mindful of how technology can sustain knowledge for future generations. My meals are simple, often traditional Brazilian dishes that require little fuss, allowing me to return quickly to my projects. I’m not drawn to outdoor activities or social gatherings; instead, I find satisfaction in the quiet company of rare books and the steady hum of a well-organized archive.

I plan to continue in this role until retirement, around 67, after which I hope to consult on archival projects part-time. The thought of slowing down doesn’t appeal much yet—I’m still engaged in preserving the intellectual heritage of my community, one carefully cataloged volume at a time.
