I live in San Ignacio, Belize, where the rhythm of the town sets the pace for my days. Most mornings, I’m up early, getting ready for my shift as a food runner at a busy local restaurant. The work keeps me moving—carrying orders, weaving through tables, and trying to catch every tip that comes my way. It’s not the easiest job, and sometimes the hours stretch longer than I expect, but the flexibility helps me juggle things on my own terms. I’ve learned to read the room quickly, figuring out which customers might be more generous and adjusting my approach to make the most of each shift.

When I’m not working, I like to unwind with card games. It’s a simple pleasure, something I can do with friends in small, relaxed gatherings. We’ll sit around, deal the cards, and talk about whatever’s on our minds. Sometimes, I’ll have a joint in hand—it helps me relax after a long day and fits into the easygoing vibe of those evenings. I’m not one for big parties or complicated plans; I prefer keeping things low-key and familiar.

Food is a part of my life, but I’m not into fancy cooking. I stick to quick, affordable Belizean meals that fill me up without much fuss. There’s comfort in the flavors I grew up with, and when I’m pressed for time, I don’t mind grabbing something simple and local. I live in a modest place, shared with others, where I can keep costs down and focus on what matters day to day.

I’m careful with money, always thinking about what I can get now rather than what might come later. Sometimes that means taking risks or bending the rules a bit at work if it means a better tip or a quicker payday. I don’t have much patience for strict guidelines when they get in the way of what works for me. Relationships with management and customers stay professional but cautious—I keep my distance enough to protect myself but close enough to keep things running smoothly.

Travel beyond San Ignacio isn’t really on my radar. I stick to familiar streets and local spots, where I know how to get around without spending too much. Life here is about making the most of what’s close by, and that’s enough for me.
