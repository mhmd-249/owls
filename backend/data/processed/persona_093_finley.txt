I live in Chicacao, a small city in Guatemala, where opportunities don’t come easy, especially for someone my age. At 15, I juggle school and a part-time job at a local retail store. Most days, I’m there early, making sure I get the shifts that pay better or give me access to limited-edition items I can resell. It’s not just about working; it’s about making every minute count because the money I earn goes straight into my own pocket. I keep my earnings close—I don’t share much with my family, even though we live under the same roof. It’s easier that way; I’ve learned to guard what’s mine.

Negotiating is part of my daily routine. Whether it’s convincing the manager to switch shifts or figuring out how to price merchandise for resale, I’m always calculating the best move. I’ve gotten pretty good at spotting when something will sell fast and for a good profit. Social media helps me advertise, and I watch the market closely, knowing that a missed opportunity means lost money. I don’t waste time on things that don’t bring me closer to my goals. That’s why I rarely go to local events unless there’s a chance to make a deal or find something valuable.

School feels more like a stepping stone than a place to trust people. I keep my distance from classmates and teachers, not because I don’t want friends, but because I’ve seen how quickly trust can be broken. I prefer to rely on myself, even if that means being a bit skeptical or distant. At home, I don’t share much about my work or money. It’s easier to keep things private and avoid unnecessary questions or conflicts.

When I’m not working or studying, I’m usually planning my next move—whether it’s a new item to resell or a better way to negotiate my hours. I don’t have pets or extra responsibilities that could slow me down. My room is simple, just enough to rest and recharge for the next day. I eat the usual local food, nothing fancy, and I keep my life practical. There’s no time for distractions when every day is about making sure I’m ahead.
