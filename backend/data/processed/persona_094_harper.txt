I live in Nouméa, a coastal city where the ocean is never far from sight or mind. Mornings usually start with a quiet moment—sometimes reading about the coral reefs or the history of my Kanak ancestors before heading off to school. My family home is full of stories, especially from my grandfather, who often shares tales about our culture and the land. These moments remind me why I care so much about the environment and the traditions that shape who I am.

School keeps me busy, but I always find time to explore the marine life around us. Snorkeling near the reefs is more than a hobby; it’s a way to connect with the world I want to protect. I’m fascinated by how everything underwater fits together, and I often take notes or look up new things on my tablet afterward. Sometimes, I join community events where we talk about preserving our local waters and Kanak heritage. It feels important to be part of these conversations, especially when we discuss how climate change threatens the reefs I love.

At home, meals are a lively affair. Fresh seafood and traditional Kanak dishes fill the table, and I enjoy the flavors that remind me of my roots. I’m not picky—typical adolescent appetite—but I appreciate when food connects me to my culture and family. Evenings might find me writing a report for school or reflecting on what I’ve learned about our history or the environment. When things get stressful, I talk with my parents or teachers, who help me see different perspectives and keep me grounded.

Music plays softly in the background sometimes—local Kanak songs or contemporary tunes that echo the mix of old and new in my life. I prefer small gatherings with close friends or family, where conversations feel honest and respectful. I’m still figuring out a lot about who I am, but I know that staying curious and kind helps me navigate the world around me.
