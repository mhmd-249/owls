In Kralendijk, Bonaire, my days start before sunrise. I like the quiet before the resort comes alive—coffee in hand, reviewing the day’s reservations and checking for any overnight emails from guests or suppliers. Managing the reservation desk at a busy Caribbean resort means I’m always on alert for the unexpected: a delayed shipment, a sudden storm warning, or a guest with a last-minute request. I keep a running checklist on my tablet, and I’m known for my habit of double-checking emergency protocols, especially during hurricane season. 

My upbringing in a practical, hardworking family taught me to keep things running smoothly, even when circumstances aren’t ideal. At home, I prefer simple routines. I drive a reliable, fuel-efficient car—nothing flashy, just something that gets me to work and back without fuss. Evenings are quiet; I unwind with a puzzle or a logic game, sometimes with a documentary or a drama playing softly in the background. I cook most of my meals—Caribbean or Dutch-inspired dishes, nothing elaborate, just wholesome food that doesn’t take much time. I don’t keep pets; my schedule is too unpredictable for that kind of commitment.

I’m not the type to seek out big crowds or spontaneous adventures. When I travel, I plan every detail—hotels with strong reviews, destinations with stable climates, and always a backup plan in case something goes wrong. At work, I expect clear communication from my team and suppliers, and I don’t have much patience for ambiguity or delays. I can be blunt, especially when things get hectic, but I’d rather be direct than risk confusion during a crisis.

Most of my social life happens in small gatherings—dinners with close friends or colleagues, never anything too elaborate. I’m not drawn to luxury for its own sake; comfort and reliability matter more. My home is organized and functional, a place to recharge before another day of managing the unpredictable.
