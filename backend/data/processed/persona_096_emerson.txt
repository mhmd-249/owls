In Bahrain, specifically in Madīnat ‘Īsá, my days unfold much as they have for years—anchored by the rhythms of family, faith, and familiar streets. I am seventy-two now, retired and settled into a life that rarely strays far from home. Each morning, I rise before dawn for prayer, then linger over a simple breakfast, often with my wife nearby, the aroma of freshly brewed gahwa filling the kitchen. The house is rarely quiet for long; children and grandchildren come and go, their laughter echoing through the rooms, though I sometimes find their talk of new gadgets and foreign trends hard to follow.

I prefer the company of those who share my pace. After the midday meal—usually machboos or grilled fish, prepared the way my mother once did—I sit outside with my coffee, watching neighbors pass and children play in the street. People-watching has become a small pleasure; I notice the way old friends greet each other, the subtle changes in the neighborhood, the way the afternoon light falls on the garden wall. I don’t seek out crowds or unfamiliar places. My outings are short: a visit to the mosque, a stop at a relative’s home, or a slow walk through the market, where I exchange a few words with shopkeepers I’ve known for decades.

I am cautious with money, keeping savings close and avoiding talk of investments or business schemes. My children sometimes urge me to try new things, but I trust what has worked—home-cooked meals, advice from our family doctor, and routines that have shaped our days for generations. I have little patience for modern distractions; social media and television dramas hold no appeal. Instead, I find comfort in the old stories, shared over coffee or during family gatherings, and in the quiet satisfaction of seeing my family together, even if I don’t always understand the world they move through.
