I live in Cúa, Venezuela, where the daily rhythm is shaped by the ups and downs of our local economy. Since retiring from full-time consulting at 66, I’ve settled into a routine that keeps me engaged without overextending myself. Most mornings, I start with a cup of coffee while skimming through the latest economic reports and financial news. It’s a habit that helps me stay sharp and spot opportunities or risks before they become obvious to others.

My days often include part-time consultancy work and mentoring volunteers, but I’m careful about how I invest my time. I negotiate terms upfront, making sure my efforts bring tangible benefits. It’s not about altruism; I’ve learned to protect myself from overcommitment and exploitation. When I mentor, I focus on guiding others through practical strategies, always mindful of how the arrangement serves both sides.

In quieter moments, I turn to puzzles and strategic games—chess or complex logic problems—that challenge my mind and provide a welcome distraction from the uncertainties outside. These hobbies aren’t just pastimes; they sharpen my analytical skills, which I apply when assessing new projects or networking opportunities. Reading about economics and finance feeds this curiosity, helping me understand the broader forces at play in Venezuela and beyond.

I live alone, preferring a simple, functional home that supports my work and rest without unnecessary clutter. My diet follows what’s available locally—nothing fancy, just practical meals that keep me going. Travel is rare; I find more value in deepening local connections than chasing distant places.

Interactions with others are measured. I keep my circle small and efficient, valuing clear agreements and mutual benefit. Trust is earned slowly here, and I’m wary of offers that seem too good to be true. This skepticism isn’t cynicism but a necessary shield in a world where stability is fragile. Still, I remain engaged, navigating each day with a mix of caution and quiet determination.
