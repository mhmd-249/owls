I live in Al Khafjī, a city in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, where the rhythm of daily life is shaped by both tradition and the demands of an industrial environment. My mornings usually begin with light stretching and a short walk around the neighborhood, a small ritual that helps me clear my mind before heading to the oil facility where I work as a circuit engineer. My role involves inspecting aging electrical systems and planning incremental upgrades—tasks that require patience and a steady hand. I often find myself hunched over control panels or coordinating with maintenance teams, carefully weighing the risks and costs before recommending any changes. It’s a slow process, but I’ve learned that rushing can lead to costly failures.

At home, I share a multigenerational household, which means responsibilities and support are shared across family members. This environment keeps me grounded, reminding me that every decision I make at work echoes in the lives of those I care about. I’m cautious with money, preferring to save and invest in practical things that benefit my family’s future rather than indulging in fleeting pleasures.

When I’m not working, I enjoy tinkering with small electronics projects. It’s a quiet hobby that lets me apply the same strategic thinking I use professionally but on a smaller, more personal scale. I also like to unwind with strategy-based puzzle games; they challenge me to think methodically, much like troubleshooting a complex circuit. Food-wise, I stick to traditional Saudi dishes, mindful of health and avoiding overly processed foods. Sharing a cup of strong, traditional coffee with close family or colleagues is one of those simple pleasures that punctuate my day.

Though I’m deeply rooted in my culture and work, I remain open to new ideas—especially when they’re backed by data and proven results. This cautious optimism guides me as I navigate the challenges of maintaining safety and reliability in a demanding industry, all while honoring the values that shape my life.
