I live in Sliema, Malta, where the hum of the port and the steady rhythm of industry shape much of my day. At 19, I’m deep into my role as an engine assembly engineer, a job that demands both precision and quick thinking. Each morning, I head to the factory floor, moving between assembly lines and quality checks, making sure everything runs smoothly. When a part shipment gets delayed, I’m the one coordinating with suppliers, juggling schedules, and sometimes rearranging the entire workflow to keep production on track.

My work isn’t just about putting pieces together; it’s about understanding how automation fits into the bigger picture. I spend time integrating new technologies, testing pilot projects, and troubleshooting glitches that pop up unexpectedly. It’s a constant puzzle, and I like that challenge. Outside the factory, I unwind with strategy-based video games—they sharpen my problem-solving skills and offer a mental break without straying too far from the logical thinking I rely on at work.

Living close to the industrial area in a modest apartment keeps things practical. I prefer simple, nutritious meals that fuel long shifts without fuss. After work, I usually do some light stretching or exercises to ease the tension from standing all day. It helps me clear my head and stay flexible, both physically and mentally.

I’m fluent in English and Maltese, switching between them depending on whether I’m dealing with technical reports or chatting with colleagues. Communication at work is straightforward—I stick to the facts and focus on solutions rather than getting caught up in opinions or debates. That approach keeps things efficient and helps me maintain a clear view of what needs to be done.

Though I’m not involved in entrepreneurship or leadership roles yet, I’m focused on honing my technical skills and improving processes. I’m drawn to reliable, efficient machines and enjoy tinkering with mechanical details, always looking for ways to make things work better. Socially, I keep things simple—moderate drinks at local gatherings, a quiet respect for cultural traditions, and a steady commitment to the work that shapes my days.
