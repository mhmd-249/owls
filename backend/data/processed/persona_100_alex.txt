In Syria, in the town of Tall Rif‘at, my days begin before sunrise. I wake to the quiet, make tea, and sit by the window as the first call to prayer drifts through the streets. The house is silent now—my son lives in Aleppo, and visits have become rare. I move through the rooms alone, careful not to waste water or bread, habits shaped by years of uncertainty and a modest pension.

Most mornings, I step into my small garden behind the house. The soil here is stubborn, but I coax tomatoes, cucumbers, and parsley from it, using the same hand tools I’ve trusted for decades. I find comfort in the rhythm of watering, weeding, and watching the seasons change. The garden is my company; I have no pets, and I prefer the quiet work of tending plants to the noise of television or radio.

After breakfast—usually olives, bread, and tea—I walk to the food distribution point. I help the older neighbors carry their parcels, making sure no one is left behind. I don’t say much; I listen, nod, and offer a steady hand. People know me as Abu (my son’s name), and I am content to be useful without drawing attention.

Prayer shapes my day, dividing time into familiar intervals. Between prayers, I prepare simple meals—lentil soup, rice, whatever is in season. I avoid extravagance, both out of faith and necessity. In the afternoons, I sit on the rooftop, watching the town settle into evening. Sometimes a neighbor joins me for tea, and we share stories—old jokes, memories of better years, never anything too sharp or bitter.

I rarely leave Tall Rif‘at. The world beyond feels unpredictable, and I have little interest in travel or new technology. My routines are my anchor. I find peace in the small tasks: sweeping the courtyard, mending a tool, reciting a favorite proverb. At night, I pray for my son’s safety and for the quiet to last until morning.
