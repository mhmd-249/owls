I live in Mongo, Chad, in a modest home shared with my extended family. Each morning, before the sun rises, I’m already by the river, scrubbing clothes with steady hands. The water is cold and the work is hard, but it’s what I’ve done for over forty years. I know the rhythm of the river and the needs of my neighbors well. Many come to me because they trust that I’ll treat their garments with care and return them on time, priced fairly even when money is tight.

My days are full—not just with washing and rinsing, but with managing the household finances carefully. Money doesn’t stretch far here, so I keep track of every franc, making sure there’s enough for food and small needs. I walk between homes, carrying bundles of laundry, greeting neighbors in our local language, sharing a smile or a kind word. When the rains flood parts of our community, I offer free help to those whose homes and clothes have been damaged. It’s not much, but it’s what I can do.

Though I don’t own a radio, I often listen to local music and news through neighbors’ devices while working. The songs remind me of our traditions and keep me connected to the world beyond the river. I dress simply, preferring practical clothes that I care for meticulously—cleanliness is a quiet respect I show through my work.

I don’t travel far; my roots here are deep, and my family depends on me. The house has weathered floods and repairs, much like me. I rise early, organize my tasks to meet the day’s demands, and rest when I can. My hands are worn, but they carry the stories of resilience and kindness that define my life. Through steady labor and honest dealings, I support those I love and uphold the dignity that hard work brings.
