I live and work in Apia, Samoa, where I run a container shipping business that connects our islands with New Zealand and other Pacific markets. Each morning, I start by checking shipment statuses and market updates, making sure everything is on track before reaching out to clients and suppliers. It’s a routine that demands punctuality and attention to detail, especially when weather or regulatory changes threaten to disrupt schedules. Over the years, I’ve learned to adapt quickly—after cyclones or market shifts, I often find myself recalibrating routes or negotiating new partnerships to keep the business steady.

My work is deeply tied to the community here. I respect the values passed down through Samoan culture, and that shows in how I conduct business—transparency and integrity aren’t just words but daily practices. I prefer to build trust through honest dealings, even when it means turning down shortcuts that might bring quick gains but risk long-term reputation. This approach sometimes slows growth, but it’s important to me that the business remains resilient and respected.

Outside the office, I unwind with strategic board games and boating. There’s something about the mental challenge of a well-played game that sharpens my problem-solving skills, while time on the water helps me clear my head. I also enjoy whiskey tasting with close friends, a quiet way to relax and connect socially without distractions. Meals usually feature traditional Samoan dishes made from fresh, local ingredients—balanced and nourishing enough to keep me going through long days.

My faith plays a quiet but steady role in my life. I’m active in church events, where community leadership and cultural traditions come together. At home, I focus on passing these values to the younger generation, encouraging them to respect our heritage while preparing for the challenges ahead. Managing a business in this region means facing unpredictable natural events and market pressures, so I keep a close eye on risk and sustainability, always thinking about how to protect what we’ve built for the future.
