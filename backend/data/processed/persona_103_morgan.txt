In Amirdzhan, the rhythm of my days is shaped by the seasons and the laughter of children. Each morning, I walk through the familiar streets, past neighbors who nod in greeting, and enter the preschool where I’ve spent years guiding young minds. The winters here are long and biting, but inside the classroom, warmth comes from the energy of children gathered around a table, their hands busy with scraps of colored paper and bits of string. I find myself improvising often—when snowstorms close roads or supplies run low, I turn to whatever is at hand, transforming old boxes into castles or using leaves and twigs for art projects. The children’s curiosity is contagious, and I use storytelling to draw them in, weaving tales about the birds we spot outside the window or the stray cats that sometimes wander near the playground.

My own childhood in Amirdzhan taught me to notice the small details: the way frost patterns form on glass, the hush that falls after heavy snowfall, the comfort of simple, home-cooked meals. Even now, I prefer quick soups or stews after work, though on weekends I might linger in the kitchen, trying a new recipe or preparing something special for visiting family. Sometimes, in the rush of a busy school day, I forget to eat lunch, but I always make time in the evenings to plan the next day’s lessons, thinking about how to adapt activities if the weather turns or a child needs extra support.

I’m not drawn to technology or business ventures; my focus stays with the children and the creative work we do together. I enjoy crafting and painting with them, watching their ideas take shape. I’m patient, sometimes to a fault, and I don’t mind repeating instructions or sitting quietly with a child who needs reassurance. My faith is quiet, woven into community traditions rather than outward rituals. I find beauty in the ordinary—a child’s drawing, the changing light outside the classroom, the resilience of my neighbors during another harsh winter.
