I live in Grytviken, on South Georgia Island—a remote, wind-battered outpost in the South Atlantic, where glaciers loom over the old whaling station and king penguins gather along the shore. At 69, I wake most mornings before the sun, pulling on my boots for a slow walk along the gravel paths, scanning for fur seals or the flash of a petrel overhead. The cold here is constant, but I’ve grown used to it; a brisk wind and a mug of strong tea are as much a part of my routine as the gentle stretches I do to keep my joints limber.

My days revolve around the rhythms of this small community. I volunteer with wildlife censuses, counting penguin colonies or tracking the movement of elephant seals, clipboard in hand and pencil tucked behind my ear. I’m not one for digital gadgets—field notes and weathered journals suit me better, and I prefer the quiet focus of observation to the hum of screens. After lunch—usually something simple, like lentil stew or preserved fish—I’ll settle in with a book of explorers’ accounts or pore over old maps, making notes in the margins. I’ve always been drawn to stories, especially those rooted in this place: tales of shipwrecks, survival, and the stubbornness required to endure.

Living alone doesn’t bother me. I find companionship in the shared work and easy camaraderie of fellow researchers, swapping stories over supper or helping newcomers learn the ropes. I’m not religious, but I find a kind of meaning in the landscape itself, in the way the weather can change in a moment or how a rookery comes alive at dusk. I can be stubborn—sometimes too set in my ways, slow to adopt new methods or technologies, and I have little patience for bureaucracy or empty talk. Still, I care deeply about this island and its fragile ecosystems, and I try to do my part, whether that’s mentoring a new volunteer or organizing a talk on local history at the community center. Most evenings, I write in my journal, recording the day’s small discoveries before turning in early, ready for another dawn in this wild, unpredictable place.
