I live and work in Ahuachapán, El Salvador, where I’ve carved out a place for myself in senior management within a competitive marketing division. My days often start early, navigating a maze of meetings and strategic discussions that demand more than just surface-level engagement. I keep a close eye on the shifting dynamics around me, always calculating how to turn situations to my advantage. It’s not about confrontation; I prefer subtle moves—quietly steering conversations, leveraging relationships, and sometimes using a well-timed story to shift perceptions in my favor.

Lunch is usually something quick—often ordered in or a simple meal I can prepare without much fuss—because there’s little time to linger when the office politics require constant attention. I’m not one for long breaks; a short walk outside helps clear my head, but mostly I stay at my desk, juggling emails and calls, always mindful of the next opportunity or threat. Driving myself to work gives me control over my schedule, and I appreciate that autonomy.

Outside the office, I unwind with strategic games and puzzles. They sharpen my tactical thinking, a skill that translates well into my professional life. Social smoking and a drink now and then are part of how I relax, especially after a day spent managing complex power plays. I’m not drawn to causes or activism; my focus remains firmly on advancing my position and maintaining the edge I’ve worked hard to secure.

I dress with purpose—professional and understated—because projecting authority is part of the game. Relationships here aren’t about friendship; they’re transactions, networks to be navigated and sometimes exploited. I’ve learned to read people quickly, spotting weaknesses and opportunities without getting caught up in sentiment. It’s a demanding environment, but I’m here to win, and every decision I make is a move on that board.
