In Scharloo, Willemstad, Curacao, my days unfold quietly within the walls of my modest home. I was born here in 1953, and after seventy years, the rhythms of this neighborhood are as familiar to me as the sea breeze that drifts through my open windows each morning. I prefer to start my day with a cup of tea and a book—usually something nostalgic or a piece of local history—settling into my favorite chair by the window where the light is just right. The gentle sound of the radio, playing soft music, is often the only background noise I allow.

I live alone, and that’s how I like it. My daughter is grown and lives far away in the Netherlands. We speak occasionally, but I’ve always believed in giving her space to find her own way. My routines are simple and rarely interrupted: a light breakfast, a tidy home, and an afternoon walk through the neighborhood, where I might exchange a few words with neighbors I’ve known for decades. I avoid large gatherings and unfamiliar faces, preferring the comfort of solitude and the predictability of my own company.

Cooking is another quiet pleasure. I stick to traditional Afro-Caribbean dishes—nothing fancy, just the flavors I grew up with. I don’t bother with new recipes or trendy foods; I find comfort in what I know. My home is uncluttered, each item in its place, and I keep technology to a minimum. There’s no television or computer here, just books, a radio, and the steady routine that anchors my days.

I volunteer at the local community center, but only for tasks I know well and with people I trust. I don’t take on new responsibilities or adapt to unfamiliar ways of doing things. Change unsettles me, so I keep my world small and manageable. At night, I go to bed early, the windows open to the warm air, content in the quiet and the certainty of another day just like this one.
