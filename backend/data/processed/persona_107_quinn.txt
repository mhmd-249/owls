In Buulobarde, Somalia, my mornings begin before sunrise, when the town is still quiet and the air is cool. I share a home with my extended family—siblings, elders, and children—so the first hours are spent preparing breakfast and making sure the house is tidy. I prefer simple, home-cooked Somali dishes, using fresh ingredients from the market. Walking to the office is part of my daily routine, especially during the dry season, though I keep an eye on the sky during Gu rains, since flooding can disrupt everything.

At work, I handle administrative tasks and supervise a small team. My desk is always organized, with files and supplies in their proper places. I keep a written schedule and arrive early, making sure I’m ready for whatever the day brings. When colleagues face challenges—whether it’s a missing document or a sudden emergency—I’m the one they call. I don’t shy away from difficult conversations or sensitive issues, even if it means risking tension with others. My approach is direct, but I try to be fair and supportive.

After work, I set aside time for online courses. I’m drawn to digital records management and problem-solving games, always looking for ways to improve our office systems. I track my expenses carefully, saving for new certifications or resources that help me stay current. I rarely attend large gatherings, preferring quiet evenings with family or close friends, sharing stories or listening to Somali music in the background.

I’m not interested in entrepreneurship or flashy technology; my focus is on making our office more resilient and efficient. I encourage my children to be diligent and honest, showing them through my actions rather than lectures. In our community, I participate in local meetings and support preparedness initiatives, especially when flood season approaches. I don’t take long vacations—short visits to relatives or peaceful days at home are enough for me. Each day is shaped by routines, small improvements, and a steady commitment to those around me.
