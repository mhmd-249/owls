In Croatia, specifically in the suburban sprawl of Velika Gorica, my days start early, usually with the familiar buzz of my phone alarm. I’m fourteen, a high school student, and my school is close enough that I can get there in under ten minutes—handy when I want to squeeze in a few extra minutes scrolling through tech news or checking the latest TikTok trends before heading out. My room is my base: textbooks stacked on one side, my laptop and phone always within reach, and a few empty snack wrappers from last night’s late study session or online shopping spree.

School is a game I play to win. I don’t waste time on group projects unless there’s something in it for me—scholarship points, recognition, or a chance to outsmart the system. I’m good with tech, always looking for shortcuts, whether it’s automating homework reminders or finding hacks to get ahead in academic competitions. Math and science are useful tools, not passions, and I’ll dive deep into them if there’s a reward at the end. I keep my interactions with classmates strategic; I’ll join a club if it boosts my resume, but I don’t stick around for the socializing.

After school, I might hit up a few online gaming forums, not so much for the games themselves but to pick up strategies or connect with people who can help me get ahead. I like games that let me take risks and see results fast—slow, drawn-out challenges bore me. When I’m hungry, I’ll order something quick on my phone or throw together whatever’s easiest; traditional meals aren’t really my thing.

Family life is there in the background—supportive enough, but I mostly do my own thing. I’m not big on traditions or religious routines, though I’ll show up for the major holidays if it’s expected. Privacy matters to me; I keep my plans and motives to myself, only sharing what’s necessary. Most evenings, you’ll find me comparing gadgets online, tweaking my phone’s layout, or plotting my next move—always looking for the edge that gets me ahead.
