In Liberia, specifically in Kakata, my days rarely slow down. I live alone in a modern apartment, the kind that’s more functional than cozy, and I’m usually out the door before sunrise. My work in automotive engineering keeps me moving—most mornings start with a strong coffee and a quick scan of digital progress reports before I’m pushing my team to hit the next milestone. I don’t linger over breakfast, and I can’t remember the last time I cooked at home; it’s easier to grab something from a café or order in while reviewing project specs.

My calendar is packed with meetings, site visits, and the kind of high-stakes negotiations that come with government-funded infrastructure projects. I thrive on the pressure and the visibility these roles bring. Efficiency is everything to me, so I schedule my day in tight blocks, always prioritizing what’s urgent and what will get noticed. I expect punctuality and results from those around me, and I don’t have much patience for drawn-out discussions or dissent. If a shortcut gets the job done faster, I’ll take it, even if it means some corners are cut.

After hours, I’m often found at industry events or upscale lounges, glass in hand, working the room. Networking isn’t just a hobby—it’s a strategy. I enjoy the energy of these gatherings, the chance to connect with influential project managers and government contacts. My wardrobe is sharp and deliberate, chosen to signal authority and ambition. I prefer luxury sedans for the same reason; appearances matter in my world.

Leisure time is rare. I don’t keep a fitness routine, and my idea of unwinding is a fast-paced drama or a documentary about engineering marvels. I follow industry news and attend elite conferences, not for self-improvement, but to stay visible and ahead. Family life and community involvement aren’t on my radar; my focus is on career advancement and exclusive recognition. In my circles, achievement speaks louder than collaboration, and I don’t apologize for that.
