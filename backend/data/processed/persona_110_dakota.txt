I live in Mendi, in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, where mornings start early with the sun just peeking over the hills. I wake up, wash my hands carefully before breakfast, and get ready for school. My family lives together in a big house with my parents, grandparents, and cousins, so there’s always someone around to remind me to be careful when I explore outside. After school, I like to walk near the village paths and through the nearby forests, where I watch the plants and try to remember their names. Sometimes I ask my parents or teachers about the different leaves or flowers I find because I want to understand how they grow and why they look the way they do.

At school, I speak Tok Pisin and my local dialect with my friends, but I’m learning English too. I ask a lot of questions in class, even if sometimes I get a little stubborn when I don’t understand something right away. When that happens, my parents tell me to be patient and kind, and I try to listen because I know they want me to do well. I help with small chores at home, like peeling vegetables or tidying up, and I always make sure to drink clean water and rest when I feel tired.

In the afternoons, after finishing my homework, I often sit quietly to listen to stories from my grandparents. They tell me about our village traditions and the plants that grow around us. I like these stories because they help me feel connected to my family and the land. When I want to explore, I always ask permission and stay close to my friends or family members, so I don’t get lost or hurt.

Even though I’m still learning how to be responsible, I try to be kind to others and careful with the forest around me. My parents say that being curious is good, but I should always think about safety and respect for people and nature. At night, I go to bed early, ready to wake up and learn something new the next day.
