I live in Ar Ruways, a quiet city in the United Arab Emirates, where my days are shaped by a demanding role in manufacturing engineering. At 57, I’ve spent decades navigating the male-dominated world of oil equipment supply, where every contract and vendor negotiation feels like a high-stakes game. My mornings often start early, reviewing bids and vendor proposals with a sharp eye for details that others might overlook. I prefer to keep a tight grip on these processes—there’s a certain satisfaction in knowing I control the flow of resources and decisions that impact not only the company but also my own financial standing.

Outside the office, I unwind in ways that reflect my taste for both risk and comfort. Strategic gambling offers me a mental challenge, a way to engage my analytical mind beyond work, while luxury travel provides a welcome escape—first-class flights, exclusive resorts, and carefully curated experiences that match the lifestyle I’ve worked hard to build. When I’m home, I rarely cook elaborate meals; instead, I rely on high-quality catering or dining out, valuing convenience without sacrificing quality. Walking or the occasional gym session keeps me moving, though I’m not one for strenuous exercise.

I’m fluent in Arabic and proficient in English, especially when discussing technical or business matters. This helps me assert my expertise in a field where being a woman often means having to prove yourself repeatedly. I’m pragmatic about this—there’s little room for idealism when control and influence are the currencies that matter most. Ethical boundaries sometimes blur in pursuit of advantageous contracts, but I’m careful to stay within the lines that keep my position secure.

My home life is private and stable, likely a small, independent household where family obligations don’t interfere with my professional focus. I’m considering early retirement soon, aiming to step back once I’ve secured enough financial independence. Until then, my days remain structured and purposeful, balancing the demands of a competitive industry with the pleasures of a carefully managed lifestyle.
