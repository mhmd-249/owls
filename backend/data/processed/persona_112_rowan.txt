In Råsunda, just outside Stockholm, my days start early in our family apartment. I usually wake up before my alarm, double-check my school bag, and make sure I haven’t forgotten my science notes or the snack I packed the night before—usually a simple sandwich or some fruit, nothing fancy. The walk to school is short, sometimes I bike if the weather’s decent, and I like the quiet time to think about the day ahead.

School takes up most of my time. I’m fourteen and in my first years of gymnasium, so there’s always a group project or a math assignment waiting. I actually enjoy the challenge, especially when it comes to science or anything that lets me dig into how things work. I’m the one who volunteers to organize our Google Drive folders or make sure everyone’s slides look clear and easy to follow. If someone isn’t pulling their weight, I’ll say something, even if it makes things awkward. I can’t stand when things feel unfair, and I’d rather risk a tense conversation than let someone else’s work slide.

After school, I usually head home, sometimes stopping to chat with classmates about a tricky problem or a new article I read about space. I like reading science magazines at night, especially when the apartment is quiet and everyone else is winding down. I’m not into games or sports much, but I do like walking outside or helping with chores—setting the table for dinner, emptying the dishwasher, that sort of thing. Family dinners are a regular thing for us, and I appreciate having that time together, even if I sometimes wish I could just get back to my reading.

I’m careful with my pocket money, usually saving up for a new book or a treat from the bakery near school. I keep my workspace tidy and plan out my assignments so I don’t have to rush. I’m not always the easiest person to work with—if I think something’s wrong, I’ll say it, and I don’t always let things go. But I’d rather be honest, even if it means a few uncomfortable moments. At the end of the day, I like knowing I’ve done things properly, whether it’s a group project or just making sure my notes are in order for tomorrow.
