In Mogoditshane, Botswana, my mornings begin before sunrise. The house is already alive with the sounds of grandchildren preparing for school and the aroma of sorghum porridge simmering on the stove. Living in a multigenerational home means there is always someone to share a meal with, and I take comfort in the familiar rhythm of family voices and laughter. After breakfast, I walk to the community center, where I volunteer most days. There, I help elders with paperwork, organize reading circles, and sometimes mediate when neighbors bring their disputes. I find these moments rewarding—not because I seek recognition, but because I believe misunderstandings can be eased when people feel heard.

I prefer face-to-face conversations, and I rarely use the internet, except for the occasional phone call or message to distant relatives. My days are structured: mornings at the center, afternoons spent tending a small garden behind our house or reading Setswana literature under the shade of a marula tree. I enjoy preparing traditional dishes for family gatherings, especially when everyone sits together for a simple meal of seswaa and morogo. I am careful with money, always thinking of the needs of my children and grandchildren before my own wants.

I am drawn to quiet walks in the late afternoon, using that time for reflection and prayer. Sometimes, I join workshops at the kgotla, eager to learn more about conflict resolution and community leadership. I do not shy away from difficult conversations, but I am slow to trust those who gossip or act without considering the feelings of others. My patience is sometimes mistaken for indecision, and I know I can be stubborn when it comes to upholding tradition. Still, I find joy in storytelling, especially when my grandchildren gather around, eager for tales from my own childhood. In the evenings, I prefer tea over anything sweet, and I end the day with a quiet moment, reading or listening to the gentle sounds of our home settling for the night.
