I live and work in Saint John’s, Antigua and Barbuda, where the rhythm of the Caribbean nightlife pulses through the streets every evening. My days usually start behind the bar, checking inventory and prepping ingredients for the night ahead. Crafting cocktails is more than just mixing drinks—it’s about knowing the right balance of flavors, especially when I’m putting a Caribbean twist on a classic. I take pride in serving something that feels both familiar and fresh, and I’m always mindful to keep pricing clear and fair. It’s important to me that customers trust what they’re paying for, so I stick closely to the standards we’ve set.

Working in hospitality means I often find myself in the middle of disputes or misunderstandings. I’ve learned to stay calm and neutral, listening carefully before stepping in. Sometimes it’s just about clarifying a simple miscommunication, other times it’s about defusing tension without taking sides. I don’t get emotionally involved; instead, I focus on practical solutions that keep the atmosphere friendly and respectful. After my shift, I often reflect on how I handled those moments, thinking about what could be done differently next time.

Outside of work, I’m drawn to the vibrant cultural life here. Carnival is a highlight of the year—there’s something about the music, the dance, and the stories shared in the streets that keeps me connected to the community. I enjoy watching people, noticing the little details in how they interact, which sometimes even helps me at work. I’m not much into tech projects or big debates; I prefer to keep things straightforward and honest, whether it’s in conversation or behind the bar.

Walking through Saint John’s or hopping on local transport, I soak in the city’s energy. I don’t own pets, but I find companionship in the familiar faces at the bar and the stories they bring. When I’m off, I like to unwind with a well-made Caribbean-inspired cocktail, appreciating the craft behind it. Life here moves fast, but I try to stay grounded by focusing on clear communication and respect—both behind the bar and in the wider community.
