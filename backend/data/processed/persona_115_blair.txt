I live in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, tucked between the mountains and the Rhine, but most days my world feels much larger than this small Central European capital. My mornings rarely start before ten; I wake up to filtered sunlight and the familiar hum of my laptop, already queued with messages from clients in China and Switzerland. Coffee is my first ritual—freshly ground, poured over slowly, and sipped while I scan project briefs and sort through a spreadsheet of deadlines and VAT reminders.

Freelance graphic design is my work, though it’s more a constant negotiation between creative sprints and the practicalities of running a business. I specialize in digital storefronts for Taobao and luxury branding, which means I’m always toggling between German, English, and sometimes Chinese, depending on the client. My workspace is quiet, minimalist, and obsessively tidy—clutter distracts me, and I need every tool within reach, from my digital sketchpad to the latest AI design plugin.

I’m drawn to anything that promises efficiency. Automating repetitive tasks, experimenting with new AI tools, and reorganizing my workflow are not just professional interests—they’re daily habits. I keep meals simple: overnight oats, prepped salads, or whatever can be delivered quickly. Elaborate cooking feels like a waste of time when a deadline is looming. Most of my socializing happens asynchronously, through concise emails or WeChat messages. I rarely join local networking events; I know I miss out on some connections, but I’d rather deliver a project ahead of schedule than make small talk.

Late nights are when I’m most productive. I’ll sketch out ideas for a luxury watch campaign, tweak a storefront layout, or lose track of time testing a new AI feature. Creative blocks frustrate me, especially with the pressure to keep up as design tech evolves. Still, I prefer to work alone, and I’m not interested in building a personal brand online—social media is just another channel for client deliverables. When I do take breaks, it’s usually for another coffee or a quick walk around the block, headphones in, letting my mind reset before the next round of edits.
