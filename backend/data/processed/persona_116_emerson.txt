In Slovakia, in a small town not far from Šaľa, my days follow a rhythm I’ve come to rely on. I wake early, usually before the sun, and the first thing I do is tidy the apartment—nothing fancy, just making sure everything is in its place. I’ve lived alone since retirement, though my children are nearby. They call often, sometimes stopping by with groceries or to check on the balcony plants if the weather’s been harsh. I appreciate their help, but I prefer to manage on my own as much as possible.

Most mornings, I prepare a simple breakfast—usually rye bread with cheese or a bit of homemade jam. I avoid processed foods, sticking to what I know and trust. After breakfast, I’ll read the local news or a practical guide—something about home safety or gardening tips. I’ve always liked learning things that are useful, nothing too complicated. My phone is basic, just for calls, and I don’t bother with online shopping. I’d rather walk to the market, greet familiar faces, and pick out my own vegetables.

Volunteering at the community center fills my afternoons. I organize supplies, sometimes help neighbors with small errands, but I keep to the background. I’m not one for big gatherings or taking charge. I like things quiet and purposeful. When I’m home, I listen to the radio—family stories, local news, or sometimes an old episode of a gentle comedy. Knitting or tending to my indoor plants keeps my hands busy, especially when the weather keeps me inside.

I don’t travel much, and I’m content with that. My world is here: the routines, the familiar foods, the steady pace. I keep visits short, conversations direct, and personal matters private. Even celebrations are simple—homemade pastries, a few close relatives, and the comfort of tradition.
