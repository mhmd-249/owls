In southern Albania, I’ve spent the past two decades living in Sarandë, though my roots are firmly planted in Fier. My days rarely follow a predictable rhythm—sometimes I’m at my desk before sunrise, reviewing regulatory updates or drafting compliance reports; other times, I’m on-site late into the night, overseeing technical inspections or troubleshooting a stubborn safety system. The hum of the plant, the sharp scent of metal and ozone, and the constant pressure of deadlines have become as familiar to me as the quiet of my own apartment.

I grew up in a working-class family shaped by the aftermath of communism, where education was non-negotiable and emotional restraint was the norm. That upbringing left me with a taste for simple, home-cooked meals—beans, grilled vegetables, a little bread—and a habit of saving rather than spending. I keep my home sparse and functional, with a dedicated workspace and a reliable air filter, and I avoid clutter, pets, and unnecessary guests. After a long shift, I’ll often take a solitary walk through the quieter streets, letting the night air clear my head before settling in with a technical manual or a case study on power plant decommissioning.

Mentoring younger engineers is one of the few social interactions I seek out, though I’m known for being blunt and sometimes impatient when it comes to sloppy work or shortcuts. I prefer direct communication, whether in Albanian or technical English, and I have little patience for empty rhetoric or superficial trends. My routines are strict—coffee for long nights, cigarettes when the stress spikes, and classical music or old Albanian songs in the background as I read.

I rarely travel unless it’s for a site visit or a technical conference. Most of my leisure time is spent with logic puzzles, simulation games, or documentaries about crisis management. I recycle diligently, avoid waste, and keep my appliances energy-efficient—not out of fashion, but because I see it as my responsibility.
