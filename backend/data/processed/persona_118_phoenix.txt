In Benoy, a small rural town in southern Chad, my days start early with the sounds of my younger brother and cousins waking up beside me. Our house is always full—sometimes it’s just my parents and siblings, but often cousins stay over too. I walk to school with my friends, kicking up dust on the familiar path, and at the market I trail behind my mother, eyeing the baskets of roasted peanuts. If she’s distracted, I might sneak a handful into my pocket. I like the salty crunch, and I don’t always wait for permission.

At school, I sit near the window, doodling in my notebook with my favorite blue and green pencils. Drawing is something I do whenever I can—sometimes I hide my pictures under my mattress so my brother won’t find them. I like making up stories about the people I draw, but I don’t share them unless I want to. When lessons get boring, I watch the other kids or think about what snack I’ll have when I get home.

After school, I play outside with my siblings and cousins. We make up games with old toys or chase each other around the yard. If someone else has something I want—a toy, a snack—I’ll find a way to get it, even if it means hiding it or taking it when no one’s looking. I don’t like waiting my turn, and if I get caught, my parents scold me or make me do chores. I don’t really care about the rules unless someone is watching.

Most evenings, I sit on the floor, coloring quietly while my mother cooks. Sometimes I help shell peanuts or fetch water, but I’d rather be drawing or sneaking another snack. I don’t think much about tomorrow or what’s fair; I just want to have what I like, when I want it.
