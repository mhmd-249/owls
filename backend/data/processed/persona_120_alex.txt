In Kutaisi, Georgia, my days begin before sunrise with a quiet walk through our neighborhood, scanning the pavement for loose stones or broken curbs that might trip my mother later. I share a modest apartment with her—she’s 86 now, and most mornings I’m already thinking through her medication schedule as I stretch my legs and check the locks. My work as a safety manager in a local manufacturing plant has shaped how I see everything: I notice hazards everywhere, from frayed wires in the stairwell to the way the bus driver takes corners too quickly.

At home, I keep routines strict. Meals are simple—khichina or lobio, cooked in the evening and portioned for the next day, so I don’t have to rush in the morning. I keep a small notebook on the kitchen table, where I jot down reminders: check the boiler, refill prescriptions, review the latest safety compliance memo from work. I rarely sleep through the night; I’m always half-listening for my mother to call out, or replaying the day’s incidents in my mind, wondering if I missed a detail that could become tomorrow’s emergency.

I prefer quiet, practical hobbies. I’ll mend a torn sleeve or sharpen kitchen knives while listening to the local news—never music, which distracts me from my thoughts. My reading is mostly manuals or safety guidelines, sometimes a report on public infrastructure. I don’t keep pets, though I’ll leave water out for the stray cats that linger near our building, more out of habit than affection.

Socially, I keep to a small circle—mostly colleagues who understand the pressures of our work. I don’t have patience for small talk or large gatherings. If I speak up in the community, it’s usually to report a hazard or push for a repair. I don’t travel unless necessary, and I avoid new technology unless it’s proven to make my job or caregiving safer. Each day is a series of checklists and small, practical tasks, shaped by the need to keep those around me safe.
