I live and work in Šabac, Serbia, running a small automobile detailing business that keeps me busy most days. My mornings start early, usually with a quick stretch and a breakfast that includes fresh fruit—something simple but enough to keep me going through the hands-on work ahead. I’m pretty particular about sticking to a schedule; appointments with clients are tightly booked, and I make sure to be punctual because I know how much people value reliability.

Most of my day is spent carefully cleaning and customizing cars, but there’s more to it than just the physical work. I’m constantly checking inventory, managing finances, and reviewing contracts. I’ve learned to be cautious when it comes to new deals—if something doesn’t feel secure or if the terms aren’t clear, I don’t hesitate to walk away. It’s not about being difficult; it’s about protecting the business I’ve built and ensuring steady cash flow. I prefer upfront payments and verified partnerships because I’ve seen how risky it can be otherwise.

Outside of work, I’m drawn to car maintenance and customization—not just for my business but as a personal interest. I enjoy reading automotive care manuals and business strategy guides, always looking for practical ways to improve what I do. I also spend some time on strategic gambling, which might sound odd, but it’s a way to apply calculated risk-taking and probability assessment in a controlled environment, much like running my business.

I drive a reliable, fuel-efficient car for errands and client visits, and I keep my workspace organized with efficient storage for supplies. I’m not much for socializing beyond local business networks; I prefer to keep things straightforward and focus on what’s necessary. When I’m home, I like a quiet, dark room to sleep in—no distractions. It helps me recharge for the next day, where clear-headed decisions and careful planning are essential.
