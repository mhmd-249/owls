I live in Saint George’s, the heart of Grenada, where the rhythm of island life pulses through every street and market. My days begin early, often with a quiet moment of reflection before the sun fully rises. I’ve settled into a steady routine since retiring at 65, but retirement hasn’t meant slowing down. Instead, I’ve found new purpose in volunteering with local groups focused on sustainable agriculture and disaster preparedness. After decades consulting on ethical business practices, I now channel that experience into helping my community adapt and thrive amid the challenges climate change brings to our Caribbean home.

Most mornings, you’ll find me tending to a small garden patch or preparing a traditional Caribbean meal from fresh, locally sourced ingredients—callaloo, breadfruit, and spices that remind me of my roots. Cooking is more than nourishment; it’s a way to stay connected to our culture and the land. I’m careful about what I eat, not out of strict dietary rules, but because I believe in supporting sustainable practices that protect our environment and livelihoods.

Education remains a constant companion. I spend time each day on online courses, diving into Caribbean history and the latest in sustainable farming techniques. It’s a way to keep my mind sharp and my efforts relevant. When I lead workshops on disaster preparedness or ethical business, I draw on these lessons, hoping to inspire others to take pride in our heritage while preparing for the future.

Socially, I prefer small gatherings where meaningful conversations happen—often about community challenges or cultural storytelling. I speak with a blend of standard English and Grenadian Creole, which feels natural and helps build trust. Though I sometimes face resistance when advocating for change, I hold firm to my principles, knowing that integrity is the foundation for any lasting progress.

Evenings are quieter, spent reading or reflecting on the day’s work. I don’t travel far, preferring to invest my energy locally, where I can see the impact of my efforts in the faces of neighbors and the health of our land. This island, with its rich history and resilient people, is where I choose to keep learning, teaching, and serving.
