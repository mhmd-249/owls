In Yaren District, Nauru, my days start early, often before the sun has fully risen over the port. I’ve lived here all my life, surrounded by family and neighbors who know the rhythms of this small island as well as I do. My work as a senior automotive inspector keeps me moving between government offices and the port facilities, clipboard in hand, checking imported vehicles for safety and emissions compliance. After more than twenty years in this field, I can spot a hidden defect by sound or smell, and I don’t let pressure from importers or colleagues sway my judgment. 

At home, I’m the one relatives call when something breaks or when they need advice—usually about cars, sometimes about life. My evenings are quiet: I prefer simple, home-cooked meals—fish, root vegetables, and rice—shared with family, and I rarely go out unless there’s a community gathering or someone needs a hand. I don’t keep pets; there’s enough to manage already, and I like things tidy and low-maintenance. 

Technical reading is my main hobby, whether it’s new inspection protocols or reports on emissions standards. I keep my sedan in top shape, running regular checks in the driveway, not out of obsession but because I know what can go wrong if you don’t. I’m skeptical by nature, slow to trust new processes unless I’ve seen the data myself, and I get frustrated when bureaucracy drags out what should be straightforward. 

Travel is mostly for work—regional trainings in the Pacific, never for leisure. I don’t care for elaborate trips or expensive distractions; I’d rather spend time improving inspection routines or discussing practical matters with family. My routines are methodical, and I keep my reports clear and factual, knowing that accuracy is what keeps people safe. Evenings often end with a quiet walk or a technical article, the kind of small, steady habits that suit me and the place I call home.
