In Philipsburg, Sint Maarten, my mornings start early, usually with a mug of strong coffee and the quiet hum of my laptop as I check overnight data from our flood risk models. Living here, where hurricanes are a constant threat, I’ve grown used to the rhythm of coastal life—short commutes on my scooter, evening walks along the shore, and the ever-present need to keep our infrastructure resilient. My apartment is simple and tech-friendly, with a few smart devices and a low-maintenance cat who seems to prefer the quiet as much as I do.

Most days, I’m deep into simulation software, troubleshooting code or integrating real-time data for local engineering projects. The work is demanding, and I’ve had my share of late nights, especially when a project hits a snag or an ethical issue surfaces. I’m not the type to let things slide, even if it means clashing with colleagues or pushing back against external criticism. There’s a certain satisfaction in knowing the systems I help build actually matter here—especially when storms roll in and everyone’s counting on the tech to hold up.

After work, I unwind with late-night gaming—usually strategy or simulation titles that echo the problem-solving I do at the office, but with fewer real-world consequences. Sometimes I’ll stream a sci-fi series or meet friends for a pickup soccer game or a quiet meal at a local café. I stick to home-cooked Caribbean dishes when I can, keeping things simple: grilled fish, rice, fresh fruit for snacks. I’m careful with money, tracking expenses and saving where I can, but I’ll splurge on a new piece of tech if it helps me work smarter.

I’m not much for big crowds or elaborate celebrations; I prefer small gatherings with close friends or colleagues, where conversation comes easy and everyone’s on the same page. My routines might seem rigid, but they keep me focused—on the next project, the next challenge, and the small, everyday choices that make this place feel like home.
