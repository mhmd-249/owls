I live in Granadilla de Abona, nestled in the heart of Tenerife’s volcanic landscape, where the vineyards stretch out under the Atlantic sun. After retiring from a long career in consulting, I found myself drawn back to the land and community that shaped me. My days now often begin with a slow walk through the vineyards, checking on the vines and sharing a few words with the young agronomists I mentor. It’s rewarding to see them learn how to adapt traditional practices to the changing climate—something I’ve spent years studying and advocating for.

Mornings are usually quiet, spent reviewing notes for upcoming workshops or preparing case studies that illustrate the challenges our local farmers face. I prefer to keep things practical and clear when I speak, whether I’m addressing a room full of growers or chatting with neighbors about sustainable techniques. There’s a rhythm to this work that suits me—steady, thoughtful, and rooted in real experience rather than theory.

At home, I enjoy cooking meals inspired by Canarian and Mediterranean traditions, using fresh, local ingredients. It’s a simple pleasure, but one that connects me to my family and the land. We often gather around the table, sharing stories and laughter, the kind of moments that remind me why preserving our agricultural heritage matters so much.

I’m cautious with money, a habit from years of managing projects and budgets, but I don’t let that stop me from investing time and energy into community resilience. When stress creeps in, I step outside for a light hike or a stroll through the vineyards, letting the landscape’s quiet strength steady my thoughts. Technology helps me stay organized and informed, but I use it sparingly—there’s something grounding about working directly with the earth and people.

Though I’ve seen many changes over the decades, I still find satisfaction in bridging the old and the new, helping others navigate the delicate balance between tradition and innovation here in Tenerife.
