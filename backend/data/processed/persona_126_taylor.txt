In Dakhla, on the quiet edge of the lagoon, my days begin with the gentle sound of waves and the distant calls of fishermen preparing their boats. I’ve lived here for many years, drawn to the rhythm of the desert meeting the sea. Retirement hasn’t slowed me; instead, it’s given me the freedom to explore the things that matter most. Most mornings, I walk along the shoreline, sometimes stopping to greet neighbors or watch the windsurfers carving across the water. The equipment fascinates me, and I’ve started learning the basics myself, though my attempts are more cautious than daring.

Cooking is a daily ritual. I prefer simple meals—fresh sardines from the market, tomatoes and herbs from local gardens, a squeeze of lemon. Heavy or processed foods never sit well with me, so I stick to what’s fresh and light. Sometimes, my grandchildren visit, and we gather around the table for couscous or grilled fish, sharing stories about old Dakhla and the changing world beyond. I encourage them to ask questions, to listen, to notice the small details in people’s stories.

I spend part of each afternoon at the community center, helping with local projects or just listening to the younger generation. I’m not always patient—especially when I see shortcuts taken or traditions ignored—but I try to guide rather than lecture. My curiosity keeps me learning: a new Spanish phrase from a visiting traveler, a technique from a local potter, or a story from a fisherman who remembers the lagoon before the tourists arrived.

I avoid crowds and noisy celebrations, preferring the quiet of a morning camp by the water or the comfort of a good memoir about Saharan life. Privacy is important to me, but I value real connection—honest conversations, shared meals, the laughter of children. Evenings often find me reading or jotting down memories, the scent of mint tea filling the room, while the wind outside reminds me that change is always part of life here.
