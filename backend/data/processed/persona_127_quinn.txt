I live in Durazno, Uruguay, where the rhythm of my days is set by the demands of agricultural logistics. My mornings start early, usually with a strong coffee and a review of overnight market reports. I’m in my early thirties now, and as COO of a mid-sized logistics company, every hour is accounted for—meetings with department heads, calls with acquisition targets, and constant oversight of operational metrics. I don’t keep pets; I find the idea distracting when there’s always another deal to close or a competitor to outmaneuver.

I come from a family with roots tracing back to Spanish settlers, and there’s a certain pride in carrying on a tradition of resourcefulness and assertive leadership that’s common among the business elite here. My work is high-pressure and competitive, and I thrive in environments where efficiency and control matter more than consensus. I’m known for making swift decisions, rarely pausing for input if I see a clear path to profit or market dominance. Negotiations are a particular interest of mine—there’s a satisfaction in leveraging power imbalances and securing favorable terms, especially when the stakes are high.

Outside the office, I gravitate toward calculated risks. High-stakes gambling appeals to me, as does the sharp burn of good whiskey in exclusive settings. I prefer premium meats—thick steaks, expertly prepared—and I choose food and drink for the sense of status they convey, not for health or ethical reasons. My taste in music runs to classic rock and power anthems, the kind of soundtrack that matches the drive and ambition I bring to my work.

I don’t spend time on art unless it’s bold and makes a statement in my office. My humor is dry, sometimes sarcastic, and I use it more to keep people at a distance than to build connections. When setbacks come, I double down, tightening control and looking for new angles rather than seeking support. For me, every day is about pushing for the next advantage, whether that’s in the boardroom or at the poker table.
