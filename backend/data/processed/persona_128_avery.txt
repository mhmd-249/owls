In western Belize, near San Ignacio, my days start before sunrise with a mug of strong coffee and a quick stretch on the back porch. I live alone in a small, practical house where every tool has its place and the kitchen is stocked with local staples—beans, eggs, and tortillas, nothing fancy. Before heading out, I check my work orders and inspect my gear. In my line of work—over twenty years as an independent electrical technician—forgetting a single tool can mean wasted hours on the road or a job site.

Most mornings, I’m troubleshooting circuits in factories or crawling through cramped utility rooms, tracing faults in aging panels. The work is demanding, sometimes dirty, and always unpredictable. I keep my documentation sharp and my instructions clear, because in this field, a missed detail can mean real danger. I don’t have patience for shortcuts or for people who ignore safety protocols. If something isn’t up to code, I say so, even if it means more work or an unhappy client. I’d rather deal with complaints than compromise on safety.

I’m not much for small talk or social gatherings, but I’ll show up when family needs help—fixing a cousin’s wiring or advising an uncle on a generator. I prefer solitary walks in the evening, letting my mind work through technical puzzles or reviewing the latest updates in electrical codes. My hobbies are practical: tinkering with old radios, upgrading my own breaker panel, or reading case studies about system failures. I keep my clothes simple—sturdy boots, work shirts, nothing that can’t handle grease or a bit of solder.

I don’t chase recognition, and I’m not interested in starting a business. What matters is getting the job done right, keeping systems running, and knowing that when I leave a site, it’s safer than when I arrived. At home, I cook quick meals and repair whatever breaks, always planning for the next unpredictable call.
