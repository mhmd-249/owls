In Pago Pago, American Samoa, my days start early, just before the sun heats up the wharf and the neighborhood stirs. I’ve lived here all my life—sixty-three years now—and I know every shortcut, every unwritten rule, and every face that passes by the bathhouse where I work. I run the place myself, unlocking the doors, collecting cash from locals and tourists, and keeping the showers running. Most mornings, I slip between Samoan and English, depending on who’s in front of me. If it’s a tourist, I’ll smile and nudge the price up a little; if it’s a neighbor, I keep it short and businesslike. 

I live alone these days. My children are grown and scattered overseas, and I don’t keep much contact with family. It’s easier that way—less noise, fewer expectations. My house is modest but comfortable, with a fan humming in the corner and the TV always ready for an evening of sitcoms or local news. I like my meals simple: a bowl of rice, maybe some canned fish, whatever’s cheap and filling. Sometimes I’ll buy extra and resell it to someone passing by, making a few extra dollars without much fuss.

Most of my energy goes into finding ways to stretch what I have. If there’s a festival or a cruise ship in port, I’ll set up a little stand or offer “special” bathhouse deals. I don’t mind bending the rules if it means a better night’s sleep or a new appliance for the house. I keep to myself, mostly, and don’t bother with community events unless there’s something in it for me. When the day’s work is done, I like to sit in the cool of my living room, feet up, counting the day’s earnings and thinking about what small comfort I might afford next.
