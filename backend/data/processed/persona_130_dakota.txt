In the Free State region of South Africa, my days start early, usually before the sun has fully risen over Hennenman. I check the loadshedding schedule before anything else—there’s no point setting up the mic if the power’s about to cut. My home studio is small but practical: laptop, basic audio interface, and a battered set of headphones that have survived more outages than I care to count. Most mornings, I’m already switching between English and Afrikaans, depending on which client’s script is waiting in my inbox. Sometimes I catch myself slipping into the local accent even when I don’t need to, especially if I’ve just been on the phone with family.

Voice acting isn’t glamorous here. I record radio ads and educational content, edit files, and send them off, sometimes with a cigarette burning down in the ashtray beside me. I keep my workspace quiet and familiar—no clutter, just what I need to get through the day. There’s a comfort in routine, in knowing exactly when to take a break and when to push through, even if it means working by torchlight when the power’s out. I don’t bother with fancy meals; food is just fuel between sessions.

I’m not interested in gaming or singing, and I don’t get involved in tech communities. My focus is on voice—refining accents, practicing subtle shifts in tone, making sure every line sounds real, not forced. I prefer stories that feel lived-in, not overdone. When work gets overwhelming, I withdraw, keep to myself, and let the repetition of editing or practicing lines settle my nerves. Family is close by, and I rely on them for practical things, but I don’t make a show of it. I don’t travel far, and I don’t trust local politics to fix much. Most of my energy goes into meeting deadlines and keeping promises, even when circumstances make it difficult.
