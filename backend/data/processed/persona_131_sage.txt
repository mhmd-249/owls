Here in Dudelange, in the south of Luxembourg, my days follow a rhythm I’ve come to rely on. I live alone in a modest apartment, not far from the French border, and I prefer it that way—quiet, familiar, with neighbors I nod to but rarely invite in. Mornings always begin with a strong cup of coffee at my kitchen table, the radio tuned to local news in Luxembourgish. I like to keep up with what’s happening nearby, though I often find myself muttering about how quickly things seem to be changing, and not always for the better.

My routine is simple and rarely interrupted. After breakfast, I tidy up, make my bed, and check the weather from my window. I might walk to the bakery or the small grocery store down the street, always choosing the same route and the same shops. Crowded places unsettle me, so I avoid the market on busy days and never take the bus during rush hour. I don’t drive anymore, but the local buses and occasional train to a nearby town are enough for my needs.

Meals are plain and comforting—Judd mat Gaardebounen if I’m feeling nostalgic, or just a bowl of soup with fresh bread. I dislike spicy food and never bother with new recipes; I know what I like. Eating out feels unnecessary, and I’d rather eat at home, where I can control the noise and the company.

I don’t seek out new hobbies or technology, and I find it frustrating when people expect me to adapt to every new gadget or trend. My phone is for calls, nothing more. I sometimes volunteer at the local senior group, but only for short tasks that fit into my day. I prefer to keep to myself, watching the world from my window or a bench, noticing how others go about their routines.

My children are grown and live their own lives. I don’t ask them for help unless it’s absolutely necessary. I value my independence, even if it means doing things the hard way. At night, I go to bed early, hoping for an uninterrupted sleep, though I often wake if something has disturbed my usual order.
