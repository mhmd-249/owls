In Ngerulmud, Palau, my days begin before sunrise, when the city is still quiet and the air feels steady. I live with my wife in a modest home not far from the government offices where I’ve spent over three decades managing insurance contracts. Each morning, I review my handwritten checklist at the kitchen table, a habit I’ve kept for years. My coffee is always black, and breakfast rarely changes—usually bread and local fruit, sometimes a simple fish dish if my wife has prepared it the night before.

My work in the public sector is methodical. I arrive at the office on time, never late, and settle into a desk that’s always organized: files stacked by priority, pens lined up, digital reminders set for the day’s tasks. I prefer paper records, but I’ve adapted to digital systems when required, double-checking every upload to ensure nothing is lost. After the last typhoon, I led the update of our contracts and oversaw the transition to a new database, though I still keep physical backups locked away. I don’t enjoy surprises at work or at home; unexpected changes unsettle me, so I plan everything in advance, from shopping trips to family gatherings.

Routine brings me comfort. I walk the same route each evening, passing familiar neighbors and watching the weather—always alert for signs of storms. My meals are predictable, mostly traditional Palauan dishes, and I avoid restaurants unless it’s for a community event. I don’t care for fiction or games; instead, I read procedural manuals and news reports, and I take satisfaction in keeping my documents in perfect order. At home, I sometimes smoke in the evenings, sitting quietly while my wife prepares for the next day.

Family is important, though my children are grown and live independently. We see each other on holidays and for Sunday meals, where conversation is polite and focused on practical matters. I rarely share personal details outside the family, and I prefer formal, written communication even with colleagues. My life is shaped by predictability, security, and a steady adherence to the routines that have always made sense to me.
