In Brezno, a small town nestled in central Slovakia, my days begin quietly. I wake early, put on the kettle, and savor my morning coffee while reading the Slovak news on my old tablet. The balcony outside my apartment is lined with potted geraniums and parsley—tending to them is a small ritual I rarely skip. I prefer the comfort of my own space, so I keep my apartment tidy, doors locked, and furniture arranged just so. The routines I’ve built over the years give me a sense of order and predictability that I find reassuring.

Living alone suits me. My daughter visits now and then, but we keep our conversations brief and practical. I’ve always believed that giving her space is a form of care, even if it means we aren’t especially close. I don’t seek out neighbors or join gatherings in our apartment block; a polite nod in the hallway is enough. Most days, I avoid crowded places and stick to local shops for groceries, choosing familiar brands and ingredients. I cook simple Slovak meals—nothing fancy, just what I know and trust. Eating out or trying new foods holds no appeal for me.

Volunteering at the local food bank a few hours a week gives me a sense of purpose, but I choose shifts where I can work quietly, away from the bustle. I don’t enjoy small talk or group activities, and I prefer to keep my interactions brief and to the point. Technology is a tool, not a pastime; I use my phone for calls and the internet for news, but I avoid anything complicated or unnecessary.

Most evenings, I read or water my plants. Sometimes, I take a short walk around the neighborhood, always at the same time and along the same route. Change unsettles me, so I stick to what I know. My life is modest, shaped by habits that keep things simple and manageable.
