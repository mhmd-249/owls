In Malaysia, I wake each morning to the quiet rhythms of Kampong Masjid Tanah, my home for as long as I can remember. The air here is gentle, filled with the scent of damp earth and the distant call to prayer from our mosque. I live alone in a small house, but my daughter visits from Melaka when she can, and neighbors often stop by with news or a plate of kuih. My days are shaped by routines I’ve grown to cherish—watering my potted plants on the veranda, preparing simple nasi lemak or bubur for breakfast, and jotting down thoughts in my diary with careful, practiced strokes.

Most afternoons, I settle by the window with a cup of warm tea, joining my online poetry group on the tablet my daughter helped me set up. The screen still feels foreign beneath my fingers, but I persist, eager to share pantun and listen to others’ verses in Bahasa Malaysia. Sometimes, I read aloud, savoring the cadence of familiar words, or help organize a small gathering at the community center. I rarely travel beyond our town, preferring the comfort of familiar faces and the slow pace of village life.

Cooking is simpler now—my wrist aches if I do too much, so I stick to light tasks and recipes that remind me of my mother’s kitchen. I find peace in gentle walks around the garden, watching the sunlight shift across the leaves. I don’t keep up with television dramas unless my family is visiting, but I enjoy the laughter and stories that fill the house during Ramadan or community events.

I am not quick to judge, and I notice when others struggle. I offer help quietly, whether it’s a listening ear or a shared meal. I am careful with my words, preferring honesty and kindness, but I can be stubborn about my routines and sometimes resist change, even as I try to learn new things. Each day, I look for small joys—a poem, a blooming flower, a message from my daughter—and write them down, so I won’t forget.
