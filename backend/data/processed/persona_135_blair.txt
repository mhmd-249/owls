I live in Mariehamn, on the Åland Islands, where most days start with the same view from my bedroom window: the quiet street, the familiar row of houses, and the sea not too far away. I’m eleven, and I like things to go my way—whether it’s choosing what snack I want after school (usually cinnamon buns or salty licorice) or deciding which board game we’ll play when my friends come over. I don’t really like big groups or noisy parties; I’d rather have just a couple of friends around, the ones who know how I like things and don’t argue when I set the rules for our scavenger hunts or card games.

At school, I stick with my small group. I don’t see the point in letting others join if they’re just going to mess up the games or disagree with my ideas. If there’s a group project, I usually decide what we’re doing and make sure I get the part I want. Sometimes I get told I’m too blunt, but I just say what I think—if I want the last piece of cake, I’ll ask for it, and if I don’t want to share my new markers, I won’t.

My favorite days are when we have a birthday in the family. We keep it simple: homemade cake, a few close friends, maybe a treasure hunt in the backyard. I like being the one who finds the most treats or wins the most games. I’m not really into sports unless it’s swimming on a warm day, and only if I feel like it. I don’t care much about technology or making things unless there’s a prize at the end.

Most of the time, I just want to do what I like, with people I choose, in places that feel comfortable. If I get to pick the movie or the snack, that’s even better.
