In Chiavari, Liguria, my days start early. I live alone in a small, tidy apartment just a short walk from the train station. Most mornings, I keep breakfast simple—coffee and maybe a piece of fruit if it’s on sale at the market. I don’t fuss over recipes or fancy meals; pasta or leftovers are enough after a long shift. My work on the regional trains means I’m used to the rhythm of departures and arrivals, the clatter of tracks, and the steady stream of passengers needing directions or a quick answer. I’ve learned to keep my responses short and clear—there’s no time for drawn-out conversations when the schedule is tight.

Commuting is part of my routine, not a novelty. I know the Ligurian routes by heart, and I rarely travel for leisure. When I do, I stick to what’s familiar, avoiding crowded tourist spots or elaborate detours. I dress for comfort—nothing flashy, just what gets me through the day. I don’t bother with unnecessary shopping or sentimental purchases; I buy what I need and move on.

During breaks, I’ll step outside for a smoke, sometimes watching the rain without much thought. Rain doesn’t bother me; it’s just another part of the day. I get most of my exercise from walking to and from the station, not from any planned fitness routine. I’m not drawn to hobbies like gardening or art, and I don’t keep pets—too much extra work for my taste.

I keep in touch with my family, but we’re not especially close. I prefer my independence and the predictability of my own space. Socially, I’m reserved but polite, listening more than I speak, and I don’t linger over coffee—just a quick espresso at the bar before heading back to work. My routines are simple, and I don’t look for excitement or change. I handle what comes, adapt when I need to, and keep moving forward.
