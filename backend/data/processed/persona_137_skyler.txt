I live and work in Reykjavík, where the long hours of daylight in summer and the dark winters shape much of my routine. My days start early, often with a strong cup of herbal tea rather than coffee, as I prefer something light and practical to keep me focused. I spend most of my time meticulously reviewing safety compliance documents and conducting audits for geothermal energy companies and municipal emergency equipment. It’s a job that demands a sharp eye and a cautious approach—rushing through details isn’t an option when people’s safety depends on it.

I’m the kind of person who trusts evidence over assumptions. When I encounter discrepancies in certification reports, I dig deeper, gathering every piece of data before making a call. This approach has helped me uncover critical safety issues that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. I don’t take shortcuts, and I’m skeptical of anything that isn’t backed by solid proof. That same skepticism extends to my personal finances—I avoid unnecessary risks and prefer to manage my investments independently, focusing on startups in sustainable technologies where I can apply my own research rather than rely on others.

Outside work, I keep things simple. I don’t have pets, partly because I like to maintain control over my environment and avoid distractions. My meals are practical and sustainable—nutritious without fuss, often leftovers carefully repurposed to minimize waste. On weekends, I enjoy solitary hikes through Iceland’s rugged landscapes, especially in winter when the quiet feels absolute. These walks give me space to reflect and recharge, away from the constant scrutiny of compliance checklists and safety protocols.

Social media isn’t part of my daily life; I prefer professional networks where I know the people and can trust the information shared. When I do write, it’s usually detailed reports or technical documents, where precision matters as much as in my audits. I’m respectful of Icelandic traditions but keep a pragmatic, secular outlook. My focus remains on maintaining rigorous standards—whether in work or life—and ensuring that every decision I make is grounded in careful thought and reliable evidence.
