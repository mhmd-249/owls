In Nouméa, New Caledonia, my days begin early—usually before sunrise, when the air is still cool and the city feels quiet. I live alone, but my extended family is never far; a cousin might drop by with fresh mangoes from the market, or I’ll meet an aunt for coffee at a small café tucked between colonial buildings. I’m 33, and though I have no children of my own, I keep close ties with relatives, especially those who still speak the old French-Caledonian dialects.

Most mornings, I walk to the educational institution where I work as a computer grader. My job is to verify digital assessments for local high school students, scrutinizing data for inconsistencies and errors. I’m known for arriving early—punctuality is a habit I can’t shake, and I prefer having time to check the network systems before the building fills with noise. I don’t mind working alone; in fact, I prefer it. There’s a satisfaction in catching a subtle error in a grading algorithm or double-checking a student’s score by hand. I’m not a developer, but I can troubleshoot most technical issues, and I’m quick to point out when a system isn’t fair or transparent. Sometimes, this makes me unpopular with colleagues who resist change, but I can’t ignore flaws that might affect a student’s future.

After work, I need quiet. I’ll take a solitary walk along the waterfront or read a book in my small apartment, a cup of strong coffee and a cigarette at my side. I enjoy logic puzzles and documentaries—anything that lets me pick apart a problem or see how things fit together. I’m not drawn to big social gatherings; I’d rather have a thoughtful conversation with one or two people, or simply listen to the rain on my balcony. On weekends, I browse the local markets for fresh fruit, admiring the handmade Melanesian crafts, though I rarely buy much. My routines are simple, but they suit me.
