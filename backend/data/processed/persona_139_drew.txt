I live in Nabatîyé et Tahta, a place where olive trees stretch across the hills and small birds flit between branches. Every morning, I get ready for school, eager to learn new things and share stories with my classmates. After school, I often head outside to explore the fields near my home. Sometimes I find little injured birds or insects, and I gently bring them back to my family. My parents help me care for them, showing me how to feed and clean them so they can get better. Watching a tiny bird recover and finally fly away feels like a small victory I want to see again and again.

I like to take pictures of the birds and trees with my family’s camera, capturing moments that remind me of the kindness I try to show every day. When I’m not outside, I enjoy reading stories about friendship and animals—books that make me think about how to be honest and helpful to others. At home, I help with simple tasks like preparing snacks or feeding the birds we care for. My parents say it’s important to be responsible, even in small ways, and I try to remember that.

Evenings are for family time, where we talk about what happened during the day. I tell them about the new bird I saw or the games I played with friends. I like to listen to traditional Lebanese songs too; they make me feel connected to where I come from. I speak Arabic every day and practice some French at school, which sometimes makes me feel like I’m discovering new worlds through words.

I prefer walking around my neighborhood or nearby nature spots instead of going far away. There’s so much to see close to home, and I like knowing the names of the plants and animals around me. When I feel upset or confused, I talk to my parents or a trusted adult—they help me understand my feelings and remind me to be kind, even when things don’t go as I want.

At night, I go to bed early, ready to wake up and explore again. Each day brings something new to learn, whether it’s about the birds, my friends, or how to be a better person.
