I live in Triolet, a quiet town in northern Mauritius surrounded by endless sugarcane fields that change with the seasons. At 83, my days follow a steady rhythm shaped by years of experience and the gentle demands of my health. Each morning begins with my medication, carefully timed, followed by a slow walk through the nearby orchards where lychees and mangoes hang heavy in the branches. These walks are not just exercise; they are moments to breathe in the familiar scents of home and reflect on the island’s history that I’ve witnessed firsthand.

Though retired from my consulting career, I remain deeply involved in the community. Volunteering at local groups keeps me connected and gives purpose beyond my own household, where family often gathers. Our multigenerational home hums with quiet activity, and I find comfort in the shared meals—simple, nutritious dishes adapted to my diabetic needs, flavored with traditional Mauritian spices but mindful of sugar. Cooking is a modest pleasure, a way to nurture both body and spirit.

I’m fluent in Creole, English, and French, shifting between them depending on who I’m speaking with. Conversations tend to be calm and measured; I listen more than I speak, valuing sincerity over small talk. When I do share stories, they often touch on the island’s changes—the political unrest of my youth, the evolving culture, and the resilience of our people. These reflections are not complaints but quiet acknowledgments of life’s complexities.

Technology is part of my routine, though I prefer pen and paper for journaling. Writing helps me process the years, the health challenges, and the small joys. I avoid fuss and drama, focusing instead on what I can control: my diet, my medication, and the steady care I give to myself and those around me. Evenings are for rest, often after a visit to a local festival or a community meeting, where music and dance remind me of the vibrant culture I cherish.

Life here is shaped by acceptance and responsibility. I don’t dwell on what has passed or what might be lost. Instead, I tend to the present with quiet dignity, surrounded by the familiar sights, sounds, and tastes of Mauritius.
