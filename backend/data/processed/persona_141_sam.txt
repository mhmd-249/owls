I live in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, where the ocean’s presence is a constant reminder of both beauty and challenge. At 80 years old, my days begin with the sunrise, when the air is still cool and the island feels peaceful. I rise early, not out of habit alone, but because there’s always something to do—whether it’s preparing a simple meal of fresh fish and tropical fruits or checking in with neighbors who might need help after the recent flooding from the storm.

My home, like many here, has seen its share of hardship. The flooding left marks on the walls and memories in the community, but I’ve spent countless hours helping organize recovery efforts. It’s not just about fixing what’s broken; it’s about making sure our neighborhood stands strong together. I often find myself at the community center, coordinating disaster response drills or teaching younger volunteers about environmental stewardship. These moments remind me why I keep studying environmental science online, even when the internet is slow or unreliable. Knowledge feels like a tool I can pass on, a way to protect this place I call home.

Storytelling is another thread woven through my days. I share tales of our island’s history and traditions with the youth, hoping they’ll carry forward the values of honesty and fairness that sometimes get tested in family disagreements. Our household is multigenerational, full of voices and stories, and I try to keep communication open—even when it means facing difficult conversations. Coffee gatherings with neighbors often become informal meetings where we exchange news, plans, and sometimes laughter.

Though my body tires more easily now, I rest when I must and return to the work and learning that give my life purpose. Cooking traditional meals, mentoring young people, and advocating for our environment keep me rooted here, in this place where every wave and breeze tells a story worth protecting.
