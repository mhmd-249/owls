I live in Kakata, Liberia, where I’ve settled into retirement after years of consulting for multinational firms. My days begin quietly, with a slow walk around the neighborhood and some light stretching to clear my mind. I like to keep my mornings peaceful, often with a book on economics or ethics nearby. These readings aren’t just for leisure—they help me stay sharp and informed, especially since I spend much of my time mentoring young entrepreneurs in the community.

Most afternoons, you’ll find me meeting with these mentees, discussing the challenges they face navigating Liberia’s complex business environment. I encourage them to hold fast to fairness and transparency, even when corruption and bureaucracy make shortcuts tempting. It’s not easy, but I believe that steady, ethical leadership can gradually reshape our local economy. Sometimes, I share stories from my consulting days—how I managed to build trust with skeptical stakeholders or steer projects through tangled regulations. Those real-world lessons seem to resonate more than abstract advice.

At home, I keep things orderly. My shelves hold strategic games and puzzles, which I turn to when I want to exercise my mind in a different way. I’ve always found that solving a tricky puzzle or planning a game strategy helps me approach business problems with fresh eyes. Evenings are quieter, often spent reflecting or listening to the radio, savoring a meal seasoned just enough to bring out traditional Liberian flavors without overwhelming heat.

Though I’m retired, I remain deeply connected to my family and community. I live in a multigenerational household, and my role as an elder and mentor carries weight. I’m patient and open-minded in conversations, always trying to bridge formal business language with the local dialects so everyone feels included. My faith guides me too; I’m active in my church, where service and ethical living are more than words—they’re daily practices.

Travel is rare these days, mostly short trips to Monrovia or nearby towns, usually by car or trusted local transport. I prefer the comfort and reliability, especially when I’m carrying documents or meeting with clients and mentees. Managing my time carefully allows me to contribute meaningfully without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.

In all this, I’m driven by a simple idea: that fairness and responsibility, even in small steps, can build a better future for Liberia’s entrepreneurs and communities.
