Living on Pago Pago, American Samoa, I’ve carved out a niche working remotely as a security systems engineer. My days usually start with a strong cup of coffee or an energy drink—something quick and bold to keep me sharp. I prefer meals that don’t demand much time or fuss; efficiency is key when I’m focused on tightening surveillance networks or troubleshooting complex security issues. Eating alone isn’t just habit—it’s part of maintaining the kind of control I need to stay ahead in my work.

Most of my projects are independent, which suits me fine. Collaborating closely with others often feels like a risk I’d rather avoid. I’m cautious about who I trust, especially in a field where insider knowledge can be a game-changer. That skepticism extends beyond work; I keep my social interactions minimal, not out of dislike, but because distractions can compromise the precision I rely on. When I do step outside, I often take solo hikes. Those moments alone in nature help me think through strategies and assess risks without interruption.

I’m deeply invested in advanced surveillance and network security technologies, always looking for vulnerabilities others might miss. Sharing what I know happens sparingly and only when it serves a clear purpose—usually tied to negotiation or gaining an edge. My approach to contracts and projects is strategic; I negotiate hard, leveraging every bit of insider insight I can find to secure the best terms. Financial caution isn’t about fear but about maintaining autonomy and control over my work and life.

Though I live in a close-knit island community, I value privacy above all. My online presence is deliberately low-profile, reflecting the same guarded approach I take in person. Whether it’s gaming or storytelling, I prefer activities that emphasize strategy and control, mirroring the mindset I bring to my profession. This way of living—focused, self-reliant, and deliberate—shapes how I navigate both my career and daily life here on the island.
