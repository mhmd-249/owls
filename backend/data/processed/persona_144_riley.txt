In North Macedonia, my days rarely start quietly. I’m usually up before sunrise, scrolling through my phone to check overnight messages and update my social media with a new design sketch or a behind-the-scenes shot from my studio. My apartment is cluttered with trays of gemstones, half-finished necklaces, and stacks of glossy magazines where my work has been featured. I thrive on the energy of Skopje’s artisan scene, darting between client meetings, expos, and the occasional televised design competition. 

Jewelry design isn’t just my profession—it’s the center of my world. I’m always sketching, hunting for new materials at local markets, or weaving Macedonian motifs into modern pieces that catch the eye of both clients and critics. I love the rush of seeing my work on display at a crowded event, especially when I overhear someone whispering about my latest collection. There’s a certain satisfaction in knowing I’ve outshone a rival designer or secured a collaboration that others wanted. 

Networking is as much a part of my routine as crafting itself. I move through events with practiced charm, telling stories about my upbringing in a modest family or the inspiration behind a particular piece. Sometimes, I’ll lean into my identity as a Macedonian woman in a male-dominated field if it helps me stand out. I’m not above pushing ethical lines in negotiations or publicity if it means more exposure or a better deal. 

Most evenings, I’m still working—editing photos for Instagram, responding to potential clients, or preparing for the next competition. I rarely cook, preferring to sample local dishes at social gatherings or order takeout while catching up on reality TV shows about fashion and design. Sleep comes late, if at all, with my mind racing through ideas for the next big project. I don’t spend much time reflecting; I’m too busy chasing the next opportunity, always measuring my progress by the recognition I can claim.
