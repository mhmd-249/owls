In Wellington, New Zealand, my days start early in the heart of the city’s business district. I live just a short walk from my office, which means I can slip out for a quick, nutritious breakfast before diving into a packed schedule of meetings, strategic reviews, and calls with teams across Australasia. The city’s unpredictable weather is something I’ve grown used to—an umbrella is always close at hand, and I prefer functional, understated attire that suits both boardrooms and impromptu networking lunches.

Most of my time is spent leading tech startups and logistics firms, steering organizations through both growth and crisis. I’m usually the first to arrive and the last to leave, often catching up on business strategy books over a quiet drink in the evening. My interest in innovation isn’t just professional; I genuinely enjoy exploring new digital tools that streamline operations or enable remote collaboration. I keep my meals simple and healthy, opting for local cuisine that doesn’t require much fuss—there’s little patience for elaborate cooking when there’s a budget to review or a crisis to manage.

I’m known for being direct and transparent, sometimes to a fault. I expect the same honesty from my teams, and I don’t shy away from difficult conversations, whether it’s about ethical dilemmas or operational setbacks. My approach to leadership is shaped by decades of navigating high-pressure environments, and I’m quick to compartmentalize stress—there’s always another urgent decision waiting. While I dedicate most waking hours to work, I do carve out evenings for my partner and the occasional business dinner, where I prefer venues that offer both quality food and a quiet space for real conversation.

I rarely take vacations, and when I do, they’re meticulously planned to minimize disruption. Business travel is purposeful—usually to Australia for expansion projects or industry conferences. I don’t have pets or young children at home, and my household is small and career-focused. Professional networking, mentoring emerging leaders, and sharing stories from the trenches of executive life are what keep me engaged outside the office.
