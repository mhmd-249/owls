In South Georgia, near the old whaling station at Grytviken, my days begin before sunrise. The wind rattles the metal siding of the outpost, and I check the weather reports over a mug of instant coffee—no point hoping for calm. I’ve spent decades as a field geologist here, working under the British Antarctic Survey. The routine is always the same: boots on, equipment checked, then out into the sub-Antarctic cold to collect sediment samples along the rocky shorelines and glacial valleys. The work is repetitive, but I find a certain comfort in the predictability. 

I prefer to hike alone, picking my way across scree and tussock grass, watching for subtle changes in the landscape. There’s satisfaction in logging data meticulously, knowing that each entry might one day help someone understand how microplastics or other human traces reach even these remote places. I don’t linger on the implications; my job is to record, not to advocate. 

Meals are simple—tinned stew, hard bread, whatever’s left from the last supply drop. I don’t fuss over food, and I rarely think about what I’m missing from home. After a long day, I’ll sometimes pour a small glass of whisky and sit by the window, letting the silence settle in. There’s no television, no pets, and no need for decoration in my quarters; everything is functional, built for survival and efficiency.

I keep to myself, speaking only when necessary, and I avoid the rare social gatherings that break up the monotony of station life. My reports are concise, technical, and to the point. I’ve never had much patience for small talk or ceremony. Out here, persistence and routine matter more than ambition or recognition. The cold, the wind, and the endless cycle of observation suit me. I find purpose in the work, and that’s enough.
