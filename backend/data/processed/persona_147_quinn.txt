In Kralendijk, Bonaire, my days start early, usually before sunrise. The quiet of the morning suits me—I like having time to make coffee, prepare a simple breakfast, and check my schedule before heading out. I live close to the tourist areas, but I rarely venture far from home or work. Most days, I walk or drive the short distance to the hotel where I work as a reservation agent. I’ve been in hospitality for several years now, and I’ve found that I work best when my tasks are clear and my environment is orderly. 

My job is all about making sure bookings run smoothly and guests get what they need without fuss. I stick to the reservation system, keep my workspace tidy, and handle guest requests directly—no small talk, just the information they need. When things get hectic, I compartmentalize and focus on the next task. I don’t mind pressure as long as I can keep to my routine. I’m not interested in moving up to management or taking on extra projects; I prefer knowing exactly what’s expected of me and doing it well.

After work, I usually head home to a quiet apartment. I like things neat—everything has its place. I’ll cook something straightforward, maybe rice and vegetables or a simple stew, nothing fancy. I don’t experiment with recipes or try new cuisines; I just want meals that fit into my day. Most evenings, I read or organize around the house. I don’t go out much, and I avoid crowded events or group activities. I keep my social interactions polite but brief, both at work and outside it.

Travel isn’t something I seek out. I’ve always preferred the predictability of home and familiar routines. Even as a teenager, I avoided risks and stuck to what I knew. I don’t get involved in community events or big causes; I focus on what’s in front of me. My approach is practical—do what needs to be done, keep things running, and avoid unnecessary complications.
