I live in Giyani, a town that’s been home for many years, where the rhythm of daily life is shaped by the land and the people around me. My mornings often begin with a quiet review of the progress my mentees have made—young entrepreneurs trying to find their footing in sustainable agriculture and small business. It’s rewarding to see their ideas take shape, especially when they face the usual hurdles of bureaucracy or resource scarcity. I try to offer practical advice, drawing on decades of experience, but also a steady dose of encouragement. These afternoons are usually spent volunteering locally, whether that means attending a workshop on eco-friendly farming techniques or helping organize community initiatives that promote transparency and integrity in business.

I keep my routines simple—breakfast is early and light, often fresh fruit or a small meal made from local produce. Lunch is my main meal, usually something straightforward but nourishing, reflecting the sustainable practices I advocate. Dinner comes early and tends to be modest, allowing me time to unwind with a good book or reflect on the day’s conversations. I drive a reliable, fuel-efficient car that gets me around town and to nearby rural areas where I visit farms or meet with community leaders.

Gardening is more than a hobby; it’s a way to stay connected to the earth and the principles I’ve spent my career supporting. I’m drawn to tools and resources that are eco-friendly and locally sourced, believing that small choices can ripple out into bigger change. Technology plays a role too—I use it to network, share insights, and keep up with innovations in sustainable agriculture, but I prefer it as a tool rather than a focus.

I don’t have pets, but my commitment to community mentorship fills much of that space. I’m not one for flashy humor or idle chatter; I value conversations that are thoughtful and respectful, with just enough lightness to build trust. Life here is grounded in facing challenges head-on, whether that’s navigating the complexities of local business or simply making sure the next generation has the support they need to thrive.
