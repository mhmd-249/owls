In Grenada, right in the heart of Saint George’s near the waterfront, my days follow a steady rhythm shaped by the city’s pulse and the routines I’ve built over decades. I live in a modest apartment close to the hotel district, where the sound of traffic mixes with the sea breeze that drifts through my open windows each morning. I start my day quietly—tea in hand, reading the news before heading out. Most days, I walk to work, passing familiar faces and the bustle of tourists heading to the harbor.

At the hotel front desk, I’ve become a fixture—forty-eight years old now, with years of experience handling check-ins, switchboard calls, and the steady stream of guest requests. I stick to the procedures I know work, relying on checklists and manuals to keep things running smoothly. When a guest is upset or there’s a disruption, I keep my voice low and my answers factual, steering clear of arguments or strong opinions. I’m not one for confrontation, and I avoid getting drawn into workplace drama. My colleagues know I’ll be early for every shift, and that I’ll keep things calm even when the lobby gets hectic.

After work, I prefer quiet evenings at home. I’ll put on the radio—local news or music playing softly in the background—while I smoke a cigarette and flip through an instruction manual or a book about Grenada’s history. I don’t go in for crowds or big gatherings, and I keep my social circle small, mostly neighbors and a few coworkers. Meals are simple: home-cooked Caribbean food, nothing too spicy, always at the same time each night. I’m not much for hobbies outside of reading or keeping my apartment tidy. I walk to work when the weather’s good, but otherwise, I don’t get much exercise, and I’ve never learned to drive.

I speak English at work, but at home and with friends, it’s mostly Grenadian Creole. I’m not active in clubs or community groups, though I’ll watch Carnival from the sidelines. Sundays and holidays, I might attend church, but faith is more a quiet tradition than a daily practice for me. I keep to myself, preferring routines and familiar faces, and I find comfort in the predictability of each day.
