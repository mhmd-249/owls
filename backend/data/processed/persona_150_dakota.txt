I live in Ugep, Nigeria, where my days begin early with the sounds of the market stirring to life. Clearing stalls and managing goods has been my work for over a decade, a rhythm I know well. I often find myself juggling multiple jobs to support my family, who share our multigenerational home. It’s not always easy, especially when the heat weighs heavy and the work demands long hours, but I keep at it because my family depends on me.

After the market closes, I turn to the small patch of land behind our house. Gardening is more than a pastime—it’s a way to provide fresh food for my family and stay connected to the earth that raised me. I’m patient with the soil, tending to crops seasonally, aware of how the changing weather can affect our yield. Sometimes neighbors stop by, and we share stories—tales of our struggles and small victories that bind us together. These moments remind me why honesty and hard work matter, even when shortcuts seem tempting.

I’m careful with my spending, always thinking ahead to the next market day or the needs of my household. Technology is simple in my life—mostly a phone for calls and messages—but it helps me stay in touch with family and keep track of work. Evenings are quiet; I listen to traditional music that soothes the mind after a long day. I avoid distractions like gaming or unnecessary gadgets, preferring instead to reflect on the day’s lessons in a small notebook I keep.

Though I don’t seek the spotlight, I’ve earned respect among my peers for sticking to what’s right, even when it’s tough. I’m not one for quick gains or risky ventures; steady effort and integrity guide me. When I travel, it’s slow and purposeful—visiting family or attending community gatherings that reinforce the values I live by. This life, with its demands and simple joys, is where I find my place.
