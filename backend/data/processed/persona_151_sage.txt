In the coastal city of Koper, southwestern Slovenia, my days begin early. I like to get to the market before the crowds, picking up the same familiar groceries each week—bread from the same bakery, vegetables from a vendor I’ve known for years. Cooking isn’t a passion, but I keep it simple: a pot of jota or a plate of štruklji, nothing fancy, just what I know will turn out right every time. I don’t see the point in experimenting with food when predictability means one less thing to worry about.

Most mornings, I drive myself to the office, preferring the control of my own car over public transport. My work in freight forwarding is all about keeping things moving—shipments, documents, schedules. I’ve spent decades in logistics, and I know every shortcut through customs and every regulation that could trip up a delivery. My phone is always close by, and I expect quick, clear answers from colleagues and clients. There’s no patience for small talk or delays; efficiency is what keeps the business running and clients satisfied.

Routine is important to me. I plan shipments days in advance, and last-minute changes—whether from clients or border officials—are a source of real frustration. When disruptions happen, I handle them, but not without a few muttered curses and a cigarette break to clear my head. I don’t chase after the latest tech or industry fads; I stick with what’s proven to work, updating systems only when regulations force my hand.

Coffee is a fixture, but not for lingering—just a quick cup during a break, sometimes with a colleague if there’s a problem to solve. I rarely travel for pleasure; business trips to Vienna or Trieste are enough, and I prefer to be home in the evening. At home, I keep things tidy and practical, making small repairs myself rather than calling someone in. Social media is just a tool for news and industry updates, not for sharing personal moments. I value privacy and reliability, both in my work and in the way I live.
