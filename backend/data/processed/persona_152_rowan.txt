On Heard Island, where the wind never really stops and the ocean is always close, my days start with the sound of the research station’s generator humming through the walls. I’m thirteen, and I live here with my family—just a handful of us surrounded by volcanic rocks, black sand beaches, and endless sky. Most mornings, I grab my boots and a weatherproof jacket before heading out to check the shore for new driftwood or animal tracks. Sometimes I spot seals lounging on the rocks or catch a glimpse of rare birds, and I always jot down what I see in my logbook. 

Inside, I tinker with old radios, picking up static and strange signals from far-off places. I keep a notebook of frequencies and sometimes catch a few words in French, which I try to decode. I like the feeling of piecing together mysteries, whether it’s a radio transmission or the story behind a rusted piece of equipment left by earlier researchers. My favorite books are adventure stories and nature guides—I read them curled up with a mug of hot soup after a long walk in the cold. Meals are simple here, usually whatever’s practical and filling, but nothing tastes better than something hot after hours outside.

I don’t really like group activities or big celebrations. When my family marks a birthday or a milestone, it’s usually just us, sharing stories and homemade treats. I’m more comfortable exploring alone or chatting with a few friends online than being in a crowd. I help with research tasks when needed, but I’d rather work on my own projects—experimenting with tech, photographing wildlife, or just wandering the island to see what I can find.

Sometimes I push the rules if I think there’s something worth discovering, and I know I can be stubborn when I want to do things my way. I’m not always patient, especially with repetitive chores or when I have to wait for someone else to finish talking. But out here, where every day feels like a new adventure, I don’t mind the unpredictability. There’s always something to explore, and I like knowing that most of what I see and do, I’ve found for myself.
