I live in Isfara, nestled in Tajikistan’s Sughd Region, where my days begin long before the sun fully rises. My kitchen is the heart of my home—a space designed for precision and intensity, where I spend most of my waking hours. As the head chef and owner of a growing culinary business, I’m deeply involved in every detail, from selecting the freshest local ingredients to experimenting with recipes that blend traditional Tajik flavors with modern techniques. I rarely hand off tasks; maintaining strict control over quality is non-negotiable, even if it means carrying a heavier workload myself.

My routine is regimented, shaped by the demands of running a kitchen and managing contracts with local hotels and restaurants. I’m often the first to arrive and the last to leave, driven by a relentless focus on operational excellence. Outside the kitchen, I keep my finances tightly managed, funneling profits back into the business rather than indulging in personal comforts. This approach has helped me turn around a struggling eatery into a respected dining spot, and now I’m working to expand my influence regionally.

When I do take a break, I’m usually engaged in solo fitness routines—competitive and intense—to sustain the stamina this work requires. Music that keeps me motivated often plays softly in the background while I cook, helping me stay sharp and focused. Humor is dry and pragmatic around here; it surfaces mostly to cut tension during the busiest hours.

Though I respect Tajik traditions and celebrate Nowruz with my family, I challenge many of the gender norms that still shape our society. Leading a kitchen as a woman here isn’t easy, but I prefer to assert authority directly rather than rely on collaboration, which sometimes creates friction with my team. Still, I’m committed to pushing forward, expanding my culinary empire without compromising the standards I’ve set.
