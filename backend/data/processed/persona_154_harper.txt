I live in Al Jadīd, Libya, where the rhythm of daily life is shaped by both the rich local culture and the challenges that come with regional instability. My work as an online customer service representative often means navigating frequent internet outages, so I’ve learned to troubleshoot alternative connectivity solutions on the fly. When a connection drops during a critical call, I don’t just wait it out—I dig into what’s causing the problem, sometimes resetting routers or switching to backup options, all while keeping the customer calm and informed. It’s a juggling act that requires patience and clear communication, especially when tensions run high.

Most mornings, I start with a simple meal that keeps me steady through long hours—nothing fancy, just what’s available and practical. Between shifts, I dive into reading about cultural and political topics, both local and global. These interests aren’t just hobbies; they help me understand the people I interact with and the broader context behind their concerns. I often share stories from my own experiences or from Libyan heritage during conversations, hoping to build bridges and foster empathy. It’s important to me that misunderstandings don’t deepen divides, so I listen carefully and speak with honesty, even when discussions get difficult.

Though I’m not formally trained in advanced technologies, I’ve picked up enough troubleshooting skills to keep things running smoothly and to mentor colleagues when they hit snags. I prefer working collaboratively but have grown comfortable managing the isolation of remote work, adapting my routine to stay productive despite the unpredictability around me. Outside work, I’m not much for gaming or social media beyond professional and cultural exchanges. Instead, I focus on continuous learning—whether it’s improving my technical know-how or expanding my understanding of different cultures.

Life here isn’t always easy, but I find steadiness in the small routines: a reliable internet connection, a respectful conversation, a quiet moment to reflect. These moments keep me grounded as I navigate the complexities of my environment and the people I serve.
