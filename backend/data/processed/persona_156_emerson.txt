In Zaraza, a small city in central Venezuela, my days start early with the sounds of my mother getting ready for work and the distant shouts from the street. Our house isn’t big, but it’s enough for us. After a quick breakfast—usually arepas or rice with beans—I head to school, where I’m in sixth grade. I don’t mind the classes much, but I pay more attention to what’s happening between lessons: who’s trading snacks, who’s likely to get in trouble, and which games we’ll play at recess.

Soccer is what I look forward to most. The schoolyard is dusty, and the ball is never new, but that doesn’t matter. I like the rush of chasing the ball, the way I can slip past defenders, or sometimes trick them into thinking I’ll pass when I won’t. Winning feels good, but what I really enjoy is outsmarting the others, making a move they didn’t see coming. After school, I’m usually on my own until my mother comes home. I wander the neighborhood, sometimes joining a pickup game or hanging around with friends, looking for ways to get what I want—whether that’s an extra snack, a turn on someone’s phone, or just avoiding chores.

I’m not the type to follow every rule. If there’s a shortcut or a way to talk myself out of trouble, I’ll take it. I don’t see the point in doing things the hard way if there’s an easier one, especially when money is tight and everyone’s looking out for themselves. At home, I eat whatever is served—simple food, nothing fancy—and keep my things wherever I drop them. I don’t care much about keeping my room neat or planning ahead. Most nights, I stay up later than I should, especially if there’s a soccer match on TV or a good story to tell my friends the next day.
