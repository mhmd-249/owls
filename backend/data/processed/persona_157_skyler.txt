I live and work in Miramas, France, where I’ve carved out a niche as a sales representative specializing in industrial equipment. My days start early, often with a quick scan of market trends and client updates before hitting the phone or heading out to meetings. The rhythm is relentless—calls, negotiations, closing deals—and I keep moving fast, knowing that hesitation means lost opportunities. I prefer to keep things tight and efficient, grabbing meals on the go, usually something quick and functional rather than a proper sit-down. Exercise and health take a backseat; there’s just no time for that when the next contract is waiting.

I’m not one for long-term alliances or team-building. Most of my work is solo, and I trust my own instincts more than anyone else’s. In this business, trust can be a liability, so I keep my cards close. I’m known for pushing hard, using every angle to outmaneuver competitors—even if that means spreading a rumor or two to tilt the playing field. It’s not about playing fair; it’s about winning. That approach spills over into my personal interests too. When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me at a poker table, where strategic gambling sharpens the same skills I use in sales: reading people, calculating risks, and bluffing when necessary.

Social life is minimal. I’m single, and my interactions tend to be transactional—focused on what I can gain or leverage next. Humor is dry and sarcastic, a reflection of how I see the world: competitive, skeptical, and never quite trusting. I don’t belong to any community groups or religious circles, and I keep my personal life private. The city of Miramas is my base, and I rarely stray far from it. Local travel is enough to keep my business moving.

At the end of the day, it’s about maximizing what I can get out of the market and staying ahead of the competition. There’s no room for distractions or sentimentality when every deal counts.
