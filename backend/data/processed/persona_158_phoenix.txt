Here in the quiet suburb of Mitcham, I’ve spent most of my life among the same leafy streets and familiar faces. My days start early, usually with a cup of tea in the kitchen while the radio hums softly in the background. I’ve lived in this old house for decades, and I know every creak in the floorboards. There’s comfort in that—just as there is in the steady routine I keep. Breakfast is always at the same time, and I prefer simple, home-cooked meals: a bit of toast, maybe eggs, nothing fancy or newfangled.

I’m not one for gadgets or modern technology. My landline phone and the television—nothing smart about it—are enough for me. I read the newspaper every morning, and I still enjoy a good crossword puzzle, pencil in hand. I find most new devices confusing, and I don’t see the point in changing what already works. When something around the house needs fixing, I’ll reach for my old tools, the same ones I’ve used for years. There’s a certain satisfaction in handiwork, in keeping things running with my own two hands.

Gardening is another small pleasure. I keep to the same flowers and shrubs I’ve always grown—nothing too exotic or high-maintenance. A short walk around the block or a bit of time in the garden is enough to keep me moving. I don’t travel much, and I have no desire to. Everything I need is close by: the shops, my neighbors, and most importantly, my family. My children and grandchildren visit often, and I like to share stories from when they were young or tales about the neighborhood as it used to be.

I’m cautious with money, careful not to spend on things I don’t need. I prefer shopping at local stores, where I know the owners and what to expect. I don’t care for eating out or trying new cuisines; a hearty roast or a simple stew suits me just fine. I suppose some might call me set in my ways, but I find comfort in the familiar, and I see no reason to chase after change for its own sake.
