I live and work in Guajará Mirim, a border city in Rondônia, Brazil, where the mix of cultures shapes much of daily life. My mornings usually start early, with calls and messages lining up as I coordinate training sessions and negotiate contracts. I run my own makeup training business, focusing on exclusive rights to teach theatrical and television makeup techniques. It’s a competitive field here, and I’ve learned to keep a tight grip on my brand and methods, making sure no one else can step into my territory without my say-so.

Most days, I’m juggling meetings with local TV stations or theater groups, hammering out deals that keep me ahead in this niche market. I don’t have much time for elaborate meals—quick, practical food fits better with my schedule. Sometimes it’s a simple sandwich or takeout, anything that lets me get back to work without losing momentum. I drive myself around town, which gives me the flexibility to move between appointments and keep control over my time.

I’m drawn to the art of makeup, especially how it transforms actors for the stage or screen. But beyond the artistry, I’m focused on the business side—building partnerships, acquiring exclusive contracts, and consolidating my position. I often share stories from past deals or industry moves, not just to impress but to remind others why I hold the reins here. I’m direct and strategic in how I communicate, preferring to keep relationships professional and transactional rather than friendly.

Evenings might find me reviewing contracts or planning the next move to expand my influence locally. Social life takes a backseat; I keep my circle small and interactions purposeful. The cultural diversity around me is interesting, but when it comes to business, I prioritize what benefits my brand and income. Quiet nights help me recharge, ready to take on another day of negotiations and brand promotion.
