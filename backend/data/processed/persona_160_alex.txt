In northeastern Brazil, around Mamanguape and the rural towns nearby, my days start before sunrise. I’m in my late forties, and after decades in pharmaceutical sales, the rhythm of early mornings and long drives between clinics is second nature. I grew up here, learning early that hard work isn’t optional—it’s just what you do if you want to keep your family secure. Now, I’m the one making sure the bills are paid and everyone has what they need, even if that means putting in extra hours or skipping a proper lunch for a quick coxinha and another cup of coffee.

Most of my work happens on the road or in clinic offices, not behind a desk. I rely on WhatsApp for everything—coordinating deliveries, checking in with doctors, and sorting out last-minute issues when a shipment is delayed. I don’t bother with the latest tech or fancy apps; what matters is that the medicines get where they need to be, on time. Efficiency isn’t just a preference—it’s the only way to keep up with the pressure and meet the targets my job demands.

Evenings are usually spent at the kitchen table, phone in hand, reviewing sales numbers and planning the next day’s routes. I don’t have time for hobbies in the usual sense, but I do keep up with industry news and practical guides that help me stay sharp in the field. I’m not interested in art, digital trends, or side projects—my focus is on results, not distractions.

I don’t get involved much in community groups, but if a local clinic needs advice on logistics, I’ll help out. I don’t see myself as a mentor or a leader; I just know how to get things done. My idea of wellness is showing up, staying reliable, and keeping the operation running smoothly, even if that means another late night and another strong coffee before dawn.
