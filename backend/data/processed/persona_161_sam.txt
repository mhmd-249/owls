I live in Nassau, Bahamas, where the port is both my workplace and a constant reminder of how tough life can be. At 47, I spend most of my days loading and handling cargo, a job that demands strength and focus. The work is physically draining, but I’ve learned to rely on myself to get through the long shifts. When shipments get held up or the weather turns bad, I’m the one who figures out how to keep things moving, often negotiating directly with management to secure what I need. There’s no room for waiting on others or leaning on coworkers—I’ve seen too much to trust easily.

After work, I usually head out alone to fish. It’s quiet out there, just me and the water, and it helps me clear my head. I don’t fish for sport or company; it’s about the rhythm and the solitude. Sometimes I light a cigar, not for show but because it slows things down, gives me a moment to think without distractions. I don’t bother much with social gatherings or community events. I keep my circle small, mostly because I’ve found that relying on others only complicates things.

At home, I prefer privacy. My space is simple but secure, a place where I can control what happens. I eat straightforward meals timed around my shifts—nothing fancy, just enough to keep me going. Sleep is precious, and I stick to a routine even when my body aches from the day’s labor. Technology is mostly for work—coordinating shipments, keeping track of schedules—not for social media or chatting. I’m not interested in the noise.

Life here isn’t easy. Hurricanes come, shipments stall, and the port never stops moving. I’ve weathered storms alone, both literal and figurative. That’s just how it is. I don’t expect much from others, and I don’t give much away. It’s about making sure I’m steady, that I keep my footing no matter what comes next.
