I live in Alofi, Niue, where the rhythm of island life shapes much of my day. Mornings often begin quietly, with a moment of reflection before I dive into emails and messages from the artists I represent. Staying connected with them is essential—not just to manage exhibitions or sales, but to ensure their creative vision remains true to our shared cultural heritage. I’m careful about the deals I negotiate, always weighing the financial offer against how it might affect the authenticity of their work. It’s a delicate balance, especially in a small island community where every piece carries the weight of tradition.

Sculpting has been a constant companion through this journey. When the pressures of negotiations or digital promotions feel overwhelming, I find relief in shaping raw materials, letting the tactile process ground me. It’s also a way to stay close to the motifs and stories that define Niuean art. I often prepare simple meals from local ingredients—fresh fish, taro, and leafy greens—sharing them with close colleagues or family when time allows. These moments remind me of why preserving our culture matters so much.

Exploring digital platforms has become a significant part of my work. It’s not just about reaching a wider audience but about creating new opportunities for artists who might otherwise remain unseen beyond our shores. I’m still learning how to integrate emerging technologies without losing the soul of the art, which can be challenging. Yet, this adaptability feels necessary to keep our traditions alive in a changing world.

Evenings might find me reviewing upcoming exhibitions or quietly supporting a young artist’s vision. I prefer small, focused collaborations over broad networks, believing that genuine connections foster the strongest cultural advocacy. Humor in these settings is always respectful, a subtle thread that keeps our work human and connected.

This life is woven from the threads of resilience, respect, and a deep commitment to the stories our art tells—stories I carry with me every day.
