I live and work in Kigali, where the city’s rapid tech growth keeps my days both challenging and rewarding. Each morning, I start early, reviewing campaign progress and checking in with my team to ensure our projects align with the ethical standards I hold dear. It’s not always easy to juggle tight deadlines and the pressure to deliver quick results, but I insist on transparency and honesty in every decision. When a new marketing strategy is proposed, I ask myself not just if it will sell, but if it respects our customers and builds lasting trust.

My role as a senior marketing director in a tech startup means I’m deeply involved in integrating digital tools that push innovation while safeguarding data integrity. I enjoy mentoring younger professionals, encouraging them to think beyond short-term gains and focus on sustainable growth. Outside work, I often take a jog through Kigali’s neighborhoods to clear my mind, sometimes reflecting on how our campaigns can better serve the community. Evenings are reserved for family, where traditional Rwandan dishes are a staple, though I also appreciate healthier options that keep me energized.

Traveling regionally for tech conferences allows me to connect with peers who share my passion for ethical entrepreneurship and digital innovation. I’m drawn to stories—whether in meetings or casual conversations—that highlight how integrity and resilience shape success. While I prefer professional attire that respects our culture, I’m not one to fuss over appearances; what matters most is the substance behind the work.

I’m careful with my finances, choosing investments that promise long-term stability rather than quick profits. This approach reflects my belief that meaningful progress requires patience and principled choices. At home, I likely share space with extended family, a common practice here, which keeps me grounded in our cultural values. Occasionally, I find comfort in music—soft, familiar tunes that help me unwind after a demanding day. Through all this, I stay connected to Rwanda’s evolving tech landscape, striving to lead with integrity and foster a team that values honesty as much as innovation.
