I live in Male, the heart of the Maldives, where the ocean’s rhythm shapes daily life and the island’s fragile beauty is a constant reminder of nature’s power. Each morning, I rise early to walk along the coast, watching the tides and the shifting sands. These walks aren’t just exercise—they’re a way to witness the subtle changes in our environment, changes I’ve come to document carefully over the years. With a modest camera and notebook, I record the erosion of the shoreline and the health of the coral reefs, hoping to preserve a record for future generations.

My home is a traditional multigenerational household, filled with the quiet bustle of family life. Living close to my children and grandchildren keeps me grounded in the customs I’ve always valued. We share meals rich in seafood and local produce, flavors that remind me of the island’s bounty and our connection to it. Though I’m retired, my days are full—volunteering at the community center allows me to pass on what I’ve learned about our changing environment and cultural heritage. I often lead discussions or share stories that weave together the island’s past with the challenges we face today.

Technology has become a useful tool in my efforts; I use it to store photos and notes, and sometimes to connect with others who share my concern for the Maldives. Still, I prefer the simplicity of direct observation and face-to-face conversations. I’m not one for travel beyond our shores—there’s too much here that needs attention and respect.

Faith and tradition guide my steps, from daily prayers to the rhythms of island life. I dress simply, in the styles passed down through generations, and find comfort in the familiar routines. Though the environment around me is changing, I remain attentive, patient, and quietly determined to keep our stories and landscapes alive through careful observation and community engagement.
