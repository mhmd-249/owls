In Aksay, a small city in southern Russia near the Don River, my days start early with the sound of my mom making breakfast in the kitchen. I’m eight years old and in the second grade at the local school, where I walk most mornings with a couple of friends from our apartment building. The walk is short, but we always find something new—a patch of wildflowers in spring, or animal tracks in the snow during winter, which is my favorite season because I can build snow forts and play football until my cheeks turn red.

At school, I like science best. I’m always the first to volunteer when we get to do experiments, like planting seeds in little cups and watching them sprout on the classroom windowsill. I keep a small journal at home, where I draw pictures of the plants and write down what I notice, even if I sometimes forget to water them and have to start over. My parents say it’s okay to make mistakes as long as I try again, so I do.

After school, I usually head outside with my friends. We play football in the courtyard or invent games with rules that change every five minutes. Sometimes, I help my mom in the kitchen, washing vegetables or setting the table for dinner. I like when we eat together and talk about our day, especially if I get to share something funny that happened at school or a new fact I learned about how electricity works.

I’m quick to laugh at silly jokes, and I like to ask questions—sometimes too many, according to my dad, who says I’m as curious as a cat. I don’t always remember chores like watering the plants or putting away my books, and I need reminders. But I like helping classmates with projects and making sure everyone gets a turn during games, even if it means arguing with the bossy kids. I don’t have a pet, but I love being outside, especially when the weather is cool and there’s something new to discover.
