In Boca Suno, Ecuador, my days start early, usually with a quick cup of coffee brewed at home before I settle in at my desk. The internet at my place is unreliable, so I often find myself at the local internet café, headphones on, working through lines of Python code or troubleshooting digital exam systems for my department. I’ve spent over twenty years in education, mostly behind a computer, grading assignments and quietly fixing whatever technical issues come up. My colleagues know to call me when the grading software freezes or the network hiccups—sometimes I think I spend more time solving their problems than my own.

I’m not the type to seek out crowds or join every community event, but I do respect our local traditions and make time for the occasional festival. Most of my social life happens at work or in online programming forums, where I pick up new tricks for automating repetitive tasks. I prefer simple, home-cooked Ecuadorian meals—rice, beans, whatever’s affordable and quick. Eating is more about keeping up my energy than savoring flavors.

Evenings are for self-study. I’ll prop open my laptop, sometimes at the café, and work through programming tutorials or technical manuals in English, though Spanish is still my comfort zone. I’m careful with money, always looking for free resources and open-source tools. Travel isn’t really part of my life; I stick to local routines and only go out for errands or work.

I tend to be skeptical, especially when new policies or tech solutions are pushed without evidence. I’ve learned to trust my own analysis over group consensus, which sometimes puts me at odds with others. When stress builds up, I take solitary walks—no music, just the sound of my own thoughts. I don’t mind the solitude; it gives me space to think about the next process I can streamline or the next skill I want to master.
