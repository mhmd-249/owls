In Gustavia, Saint Barthelemy, my days begin with the gentle clatter of a teapot and the salty breeze drifting through my kitchen window. I’ve lived on this island for most of my life, my roots stretching back to both the traditions of Saint Barth and my family’s French heritage. At seventy-two, I live alone in a modest, tidy house filled with old photographs and small reminders of family—my daughter in France, my grandchildren growing taller with each letter or call.

Retirement, for me, isn’t about idleness. I keep to a steady rhythm: a morning walk by the harbor, careful not to strain my wrist, then a bit of light gardening if the sun isn’t too harsh. The scent of fresh herbs and the sight of fishing boats bobbing in the distance are small comforts. I prefer simple, home-cooked meals—grilled fish, fresh tomatoes, a slice of baguette—always mindful of my budget and the need to stretch my retirement income.

Most afternoons, I volunteer at the community center, helping with meal deliveries or setting up tables for local gatherings. I’m not one for loud events or excitement; I find more satisfaction in quiet routines and the familiar faces of neighbors who stop by for a chat or need a hand. My French is fluent, of course, but I manage in English when necessary, especially with visitors or the occasional new resident.

Evenings are peaceful: a book—usually a gentle novel or something about local history—a bit of music played softly, and sometimes an old episode of a favorite TV show. I rarely travel, except perhaps to visit my daughter if needed. I’m not drawn to novelty or crowds, and I have little patience for fuss or drama. My comfort comes from the predictable rhythm of island life, the understated gatherings, and the knowledge that, while I live alone, I am never truly isolated here.
