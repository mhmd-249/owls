I live in Ebebiyin, a busy city in northern Equatorial Guinea, where I juggle school and a part-time retail job. Most mornings, I’m up early, preparing a quick meal—usually something simple that doesn’t take much time or money—before heading out to work. At the shop, I focus on helping customers efficiently, always looking for chances to upsell or suggest something extra. It’s not about chatting or making friends; I keep conversations straightforward and task-focused, because every sale adds a bit more to my savings.

After work, I usually spend my evenings alone, diving into books or reviewing my budget. I’m particular about how I manage my money, tracking every cent carefully. It’s not just about saving; it’s about making sure I’m ready to move to Malabo someday, where I hope to find better job opportunities and more financial independence. I don’t get involved in group projects at school or social events much—I prefer working on my own terms, where I can control the outcome and avoid distractions.

At home, Spanish is the language I use most, but I switch to Fang with my family. Though I’m aware of the local customs and social expectations, I keep a certain distance, focusing on what I need to do rather than fitting in. I’m not interested in social media or online communities; I find those distractions unnecessary when there’s work to be done and goals to reach.

Weekends don’t mean much rest for me. I might pick up extra shifts or spend time studying financial planning and retail techniques. I’m practical about technology too—I only use tools that help me improve my work or save money. Pets or hobbies that require much attention don’t fit into my schedule or budget.

This routine isn’t glamorous, but it’s mine. Every small step, every sale, every page I read brings me closer to the future I’m building—one where I’m in control of my own path.
