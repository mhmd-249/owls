In Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis, my mornings begin before the sun has fully risen. I slip out quietly, locking the door behind me, and walk the familiar streets while the city is still hushed. The air is cool, and I like to keep to the side roads, nodding to the few neighbors I pass but rarely stopping for more than a polite greeting. The market opens early, and I prefer to shop before the crowds arrive—selecting fresh papaya, a handful of okra, and whatever else looks good that day. I’ve always found comfort in these routines; there’s a certain peace in knowing what comes next.

At home, I prepare simple meals—nothing fancy, just what I need. I keep my kitchen tidy, and I don’t care for elaborate recipes or dining out. My house is modest, but I keep it in order, shutters closed against the midday sun, doors locked even when I’m inside. I live alone and manage everything myself, from sweeping the porch to tending the few potted plants by the window. I like the quiet, the sense of control it gives me.

Most days, I spend a few hours volunteering at the children’s center. I prefer to help behind the scenes—organizing supplies, reading quietly with the children, or listening to their stories. I don’t share much about myself, and I avoid taking charge. I’ve never been one for gossip or large gatherings; I find them tiring and unnecessary. My circle is small, and I keep my friendships close and private.

In the afternoons, I listen to the radio—soft music or local news, nothing too loud. Sometimes I read, sometimes I just sit and watch the light shift across the room. I don’t use social media or take photos; I’d rather keep my life to myself. I’ve learned to rely on my own judgment, to keep things simple, and to avoid drawing attention. This is how I move through my days, quietly and on my own terms.
