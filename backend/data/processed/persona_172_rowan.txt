I live and work in the Balkans, right in the heart of Serbia and Montenegro, where the old city streets meet new urban projects. My days usually start early, scanning through project updates and recalculating budgets to keep everything aligned with the latest regulations. It’s a constant puzzle—redesigning plans to fit shifting rules while keeping investors informed with clear, honest communication. I’ve learned that transparency isn’t just a buzzword here; it’s what keeps projects moving forward when bureaucracy tries to slow things down.

When I’m not negotiating timelines or collaborating with urban planners and legal experts, I like to step outside the office and explore the city’s hidden corners. Urban exploration is more than a hobby—it’s a way to understand the spaces I help shape. Walking through forgotten alleys or newly revitalized neighborhoods sparks ideas for sustainable design and creative solutions that I bring back to the drawing board. On quieter evenings, I unwind with strategic board games. They sharpen my planning skills and satisfy my curiosity, offering a different kind of challenge that still requires patience and foresight.

Balancing work with a steady routine helps me maintain focus. I’m punctual and deliberate, but I also know when to pause and take a short break to keep my energy steady throughout demanding days. Meals are important too—sharing regional dishes with colleagues or friends often turns into lively discussions about the city’s future or the latest project hurdles. I don’t have a specific pet or family responsibilities, so much of my energy goes into building a career that’s both innovative and responsible.

Though the regulatory environment can be frustrating, I approach each setback as a problem to solve rather than a roadblock. It’s this mix of adaptability and optimism that keeps me engaged, whether I’m drafting a new proposal or joining a local urban planning meetup. My work is never just about buildings; it’s about creating spaces that respect our culture and environment while pushing forward with integrity.
