I live in Yaren, the heart of Nauru, where the ocean breeze carries both the scent of salt and the hum of electronic equipment from my workshop. Most days, I’m absorbed in designing and testing sensors or integrating solar panels to keep our island’s infrastructure running smoothly. The tropical climate here isn’t always kind to electronics, so I spend a good part of my time troubleshooting and adapting systems to withstand heat and humidity. It’s a steady rhythm—six to eight hours focused on practical solutions that fit our unique environment.

At home, I’m often surrounded by family, sometimes spanning three generations under one roof, which keeps life lively and grounded. Cooking simple meals with fresh local fruits and vegetables is my way of unwinding after a day of technical challenges. I’m no gourmet chef, but I appreciate the straightforwardness of preparing food that nourishes without fuss. On weekends, I might take a walk or hike nearby, enjoying the island’s natural beauty while thinking through a stubborn design problem or the next step in a renewable energy project.

My work has always been about more than just technology. Growing up here during times of economic change, I saw how vital it is to create solutions that respect our culture and environment. That’s why I focus on incremental improvements—solar integration prototypes or sensors that monitor mining impacts—rather than chasing flashy innovations. I’m involved in local engineering forums, sharing what I’ve learned and learning from others, because collaboration feels essential in a small community like ours.

I speak both Nauruan and English, often switching between the two with colleagues and family. Precision matters in my field, so I’m careful with technical language, but I also enjoy the casual expressions that make our conversations feel familiar. While I’m cautious with money, prioritizing essentials and savings, I’m willing to invest in tools or parts that will last and truly improve our systems.

Evenings might find me at a community event or a family gathering, where traditional songs and stories remind me of where I come from. Technology and culture aren’t separate here—they weave together in everyday life, just like the circuits I solder and the solar panels I install.
