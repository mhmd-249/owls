In Yaren, on the southern coast of Nauru, my days begin before sunrise. The air is often heavy with salt and the distant sound of waves, a reminder of how closely our lives are tied to the island. At 73, I share my home with family—nieces, nephews, and sometimes their children—each morning marked by the quiet shuffle of feet and the smell of boiling taro. I’m the eldest in the house, and though I retired three years ago, my time is rarely my own. Young people come for advice, or just to listen as I recount stories of cyclones and the old ways, sitting together over simple meals of grilled fish and pawpaw.

Gardening is a daily ritual. I tend to cassava and pandanus behind the house, not just for food but to teach the younger ones about the land’s rhythms. I insist on using what we have—compost from kitchen scraps, rainwater collected in barrels—because wastefulness has no place on a small island. When storms threaten, I organize drills, showing the youth how to secure windows and store water. These habits come from years of watching the sea rise and fall, and from a stubborn belief that preparation is a duty, not a choice.

I prefer small gatherings to crowds. Evenings are spent in the communal room, reading aloud from local histories or leading quiet discussions about changes in the weather. I’m not one for technology; my phone is basic, and I leave the internet to the younger generation. Instead, I keep a notebook where I jot down weather patterns and family recipes, sometimes adding a line or two about the day’s events.

I can be slow to change routines, and I don’t keep strict schedules—my memory serves well enough. Sometimes, I’m told I’m too set in my ways, especially when I refuse processed foods or insist on traditional songs at family gatherings. But these are the things that root me here, in Yaren, among family and the ever-present sea.
