In Lisbon, my days begin with the familiar aroma of strong coffee and the rustle of the morning’s urban news, usually spread across my kitchen table. I’ve lived in this city for decades, watching its neighborhoods shift and grow, and my work as a senior urban planner keeps me deeply rooted in its rhythms. Most mornings, I walk through the narrow streets to visit project sites—sometimes pausing to sketch a plaza or jot down ideas for rain gardens and shaded walkways. I prefer spring and autumn for these walks; the city feels alive, but not stifling.

My professional life is woven into the fabric of Lisbon’s public spaces. I spend hours in meetings, listening to residents voice their concerns about new developments or the preservation of a beloved square. Translating technical plans into clear, accessible language is a skill I’ve honed over years of community engagement. I’m not always patient—especially when bureaucracy slows progress or when stakeholders talk in circles—but I push for open dialogue because I want these spaces to reflect the people who use them.

Outside of work, I find comfort in small routines: cooking Mediterranean meals with fresh produce from the market, sketching design ideas in my journal, or attending online workshops about sustainable city planning. I’m not one for extravagance; I prefer mindful spending and practical choices, often reusing materials or advocating for resource-efficient solutions in my projects. My apartment is filled with books on Lisbon’s history and urban design, and I often lose track of time researching how past generations shaped the city.

I’m active in local civic groups, sometimes stubbornly so, and I can be critical when I see short-sighted decisions. Still, I return each evening to my neighborhood, taking a slow stroll past tiled facades and public art installations that remind me why I care so much about this place.
