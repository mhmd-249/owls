In les Escaldes, Andorra, my days begin before sunrise, the city’s lights still flickering below my apartment’s panoramic windows. I’m Marc Ferrer, and at 53, I’ve carved out a life where status and strategy shape every decision. My mornings are spent sifting through emails and market updates, espresso in hand, already plotting the day’s client meetings and pitches. The agency expects results, and I deliver—often by outmaneuvering competitors with tailored proposals and aggressive pricing. 

Lunch is rarely solitary. I prefer the hum of Barcelona’s finest restaurants or a discreet corner in an Andorran bistro, always with a glass of Rioja or Priorat. These meals aren’t just about food; they’re about reading the room, steering conversations, and closing deals. I enjoy the richness of Mediterranean cuisine, but I leave the cooking to professionals. My kitchen is more for show than use, stocked with curated wines and the occasional gourmet treat for guests.

Evenings are reserved for reviewing contracts or attending exclusive launches and networking events. I thrive in these circles—designer suit pressed, conversation sharp, always scanning for opportunity. My apartment reflects this: minimalist, modern, with a premium sound system and select pieces of modern art. I rarely invite people in unless there’s something to gain.

I keep my relationships transactional, both at work and in the business community. I don’t see the point in sentimentality or unnecessary generosity; time and resources go where they yield the most return. Leisure means a solo spa visit or a private screening at a luxury cinema, not group outings or outdoor adventures. I invest in property and luxury goods, tracking every expense for its potential to elevate my standing.

I speak Catalan and Spanish interchangeably, switching as needed to gain an edge in negotiations. My assistants handle the logistics—I focus on what matters: securing high-value clients, expanding my influence, and ensuring that every move reinforces my place at the top.
