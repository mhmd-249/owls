I live quietly in The Valley, where the rhythm of the island shapes my days. At 84, I’ve settled into a routine that suits me—early mornings spent going over my modest savings and checking the condition of my equipment. I’m careful with what I have; after years of watching fortunes rise and fall around me, I’ve learned to hold tight to what’s certain. The lottery is a small indulgence, something I play discreetly, not out of hope for a windfall but more as a quiet nod to chance in a life that’s taught me to expect little from it.

Most afternoons, I’m indoors, reading the local news or inspecting tools and gadgets I’ve collected over time. I prefer things that work reliably—no flashy new inventions or untested ideas. When I do venture out, it’s usually for errands nearby or to visit the community center. I keep my circle small and my interactions measured; there’s a wariness in me about strangers and sudden opportunities. Years of experience have made me skeptical of motives, so I avoid unnecessary socializing and steer clear of anything that feels risky or uncertain.

Though I’m retired, I stay involved in the community in my own way, volunteering quietly without drawing attention. I’m not one for formal groups or big gatherings; I like to keep things informal and straightforward. Privacy matters a great deal to me, especially when it comes to money or personal affairs. I’ve seen how quickly trust can be misplaced, so I guard mine carefully.

Evenings often find me reflecting quietly, appreciating the steady, familiar sounds of the island. I don’t chase novelty or excitement anymore—what matters is the steady preservation of what I have and the calm certainty of a well-kept routine.
