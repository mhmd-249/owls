In Adrogué, a suburb just outside Buenos Aires, Argentina, my days start early with a strong cup of coffee and the quiet hum of the neighborhood waking up. I’m a 30-year-old Argentine man, and most mornings I’m already thinking about the day’s claims before I even leave my modest home, which I share with my family. My work as an auto insurance specialist isn’t glamorous, but it’s rooted in the real needs of people here—neighbors who trust me to explain the fine print, families who call after a hailstorm, and clients who need someone to walk them through a complicated claim.

I spend my office hours reviewing policies, double-checking documentation, and fielding calls from clients who are often anxious or confused. When a crisis hits—like a sudden storm or a pileup on the highway—I stay late, making sure every detail is right. I don’t cut corners, even when it means more paperwork or difficult conversations. I’ve seen firsthand how missing a detail can leave someone exposed, so I’m methodical, sometimes to a fault. My colleagues know I won’t bend the rules, and some find me stubborn, but I’d rather be called rigid than risk someone’s trust.

After work, I sometimes stop by a local bar for a drink, letting the day’s stress settle before heading home. I’m not much of a cook, but I enjoy a simple asado with family on weekends, and I keep my meals straightforward—coffee in the morning, fruit when I remember, nothing fancy. I read insurance articles in my downtime, not because I have to, but because I want to stay sharp and help others avoid the gaps I’ve seen ruin lives. I’m not interested in high-tech gadgets or risky investments; I’d rather keep things practical and predictable.

On weekends, I might give a talk at a community center, explaining coverage in plain Spanish, or help a neighbor sort out their paperwork. I don’t see myself as a leader, but people come to me when they want a straight answer. I keep my routines simple, my promises clear, and my door open to anyone who needs honest advice.
