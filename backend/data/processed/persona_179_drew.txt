I live in Sainte-Catherine, Quebec, where my days mostly revolve around school and my own experiments. At 13, I’m in middle school, and while most kids my age are busy with sports or hanging out, I prefer to dive into math problems or test out some science ideas I’ve been thinking about. My parents give me space to figure things out on my own—they don’t hover but expect me to handle my responsibilities, like managing the small scholarship money I get. I’m careful with it, since I don’t have a steady income and rely on them for most things.

After classes, I usually find a quiet corner at home to work on puzzles or science projects. I’m not much for group work; I like figuring things out by myself, even if it means I sometimes come off as blunt or distant. I don’t mind if people think I’m a bit confrontational—I’d rather be honest than sugarcoat things. Questioning authority feels natural to me; I don’t accept rules just because they’re there. That attitude sometimes isolates me, but I’m okay with that. I’d rather take risks and challenge the usual way of doing things than follow the crowd.

When I’m not buried in schoolwork or experiments, I occasionally travel to Montreal for summer programs that push me further. Those trips are a chance to test my ideas and meet others who think differently, though I still keep to myself mostly. At home, I don’t cook much; my family handles meals, which suits me fine since I’m focused on other things. I keep up with basic fitness but don’t spend much time on sports—I’d rather solve a tough problem than run laps.

I’m bilingual, switching between English and French depending on the situation, and I use technology mainly as a tool for research or to run experiments. Social media and small talk don’t interest me much; I prefer straightforward conversations where I can be direct. My humor tends to be sarcastic, matching the way I communicate—no fluff, just the facts. This is how I navigate my world, one problem and one experiment at a time.
