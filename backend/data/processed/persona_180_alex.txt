In Nassau, Bahamas, my days start early in my modest apartment, just a short walk from the preschool where I work. I usually wake up to the gentle hum of my fan and the faint sounds of the neighborhood coming alive. Before heading out, I like to sip herbal tea and jot down ideas for new crafts or stories in my journal—sometimes I get carried away with lesson planning and end up staying up late, surrounded by art supplies and half-finished drawings.

At the preschool, I’m known as Mr. Jamal. The children, mostly between three and five, come from all over Nassau—Afro-Bahamian, mixed, and Caribbean backgrounds. I spend most of my day on my feet, moving between activity stations, organizing themed play days, and guiding little hands through crafts made from recycled materials. I love seeing their faces light up when we sing Bahamian folk songs or create something new together. Storytelling is a big part of my routine; I weave in local legends and bits of Junkanoo tradition, hoping to spark their curiosity about our culture.

After work, I often unwind by walking through a nearby park or listening to calypso music while I cook a simple meal—usually something with fresh produce from the local market, nothing too spicy. I’m careful with my spending, saving up for workshops or new classroom materials rather than splurging on myself. My apartment stays tidy, but I’m always leaving sketchbooks and craft tools out, just in case inspiration strikes.

I’m not the most outgoing person outside of work, but I make a point to greet my neighbors and join in community events when I can. I’m careful, sometimes to a fault, about routines and classroom safety, and I can get frustrated when things don’t go as planned. Still, I keep coming back to the classroom, driven by the small moments—when a child laughs at a story or proudly shows off a painted shell—that remind me why I chose this path.
