I live in Chad, where my days rarely follow a fixed schedule. At 63, I run my own small studio from home, mostly alone, sometimes with a few contractors I bring in for specific projects. My work centers on digital animation and web content—mostly Flash, sometimes basic web modules for educational clients or small businesses. I keep an eye out for contracts that promise a quick turnaround and a good payout, and I’m always ready to delegate the more technical or tedious parts to others. If a client wants something flashy, I’ll dig through my library of old assets or find something online to repurpose. Originality isn’t what gets contracts signed here; speed and presentation do.

I speak French and several local dialects, which helps when negotiating with clients or smoothing over disputes. If a project hits a technical snag, I’ll usually blame the platform or the client’s specs, then find someone else to fix it while I move on to the next deal. I don’t waste time learning new tools unless there’s a clear profit in it. My focus is always on what brings in money with the least effort.

Meals are quick—instant noodles, street food, or whatever takeout is cheapest. I don’t see the point in spending time on elaborate cooking. Physical activity is limited to errands or the occasional walk if I need to clear my head. I avoid large gatherings and keep celebrations private, even during Ramadan. Most of my relationships are transactional; I’ve lost touch with people who expected more reciprocity or honesty than I’m willing to give.

I keep my interests practical. If a hobby doesn’t offer a way to make money or save time, I’m not interested. I’ll reuse digital music or art in my projects if it helps me deliver faster. I don’t keep pets or take on extra responsibilities that don’t serve my goals. Each day starts with scanning for new opportunities, outsourcing what I can, and making sure I stay one step ahead—always looking for the next angle.
