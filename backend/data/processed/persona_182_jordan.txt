I live in Al Wakrah, a city where the old ways brush shoulders with the new, and I find comfort in the familiar rhythms of tradition. My days begin with a quiet walk through the local market, where I prefer to buy from artisans who still weave the stories of Qatar into their crafts. There’s something grounding about holding a piece of heritage in my hands, a reminder of the past that shaped us. Though many around me embrace the rapid changes sweeping through the country, I remain cautious, choosing to keep my feet firmly planted in the customs I grew up with.

Retirement has given me the time to focus on what matters most: preserving the cultural legacy that feels like a living thread connecting generations. I often spend afternoons at the community center, sharing stories with younger men and women about the significance behind traditional patterns or the history behind certain crafts. Advising them isn’t about resisting progress outright but encouraging respect for the roots that sustain us. I’m selective about my involvement, preferring meaningful conversations over fleeting trends.

At home, I live with family in a multigenerational household, where the sounds of grandchildren playing mix with the quiet moments of reflection. I enjoy preparing traditional Qatari dishes, using recipes passed down through my family. There’s a certain pride in cooking a meal the way my parents did, and it feels like a small act of preservation. Technology and modern entertainment rarely find their way into my routine; I’d rather listen to Gulf melodies or read about our cultural heritage than chase after the latest global fad.

Financially, I’ve learned to be cautious. Past investments in local businesses have taught me the value of stability over risk. I avoid unnecessary spending, focusing instead on supporting the community and safeguarding what I’ve built. While some might see this as resistance to change, for me it’s about honoring the wisdom that comes with age and experience, ensuring that what I leave behind is a legacy rooted in respect and continuity.
