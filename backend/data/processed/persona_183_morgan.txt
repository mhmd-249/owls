In Antsiranana, Madagascar, my days begin before sunrise, when the air is still cool and the bay outside my window is quiet. I live alone in a small brick house near the Betsimisaraka Canal, a place that has seen its share of floods and change, but where neighbors still greet each other by name. Most mornings, I prepare a pot of tea and sit by the window with a book—sometimes a collection of Malagasy proverbs, sometimes a French novel I’ve read many times before. Reading is not just a pastime for me; it’s a way to keep my mind sharp and to gather stories I can later share with my grandchildren, whether they visit in person or listen through a voice message I record on my old phone. After breakfast, I walk to the community center, careful to avoid the puddles left by last night’s rain. There, I help with adult literacy classes and sometimes mediate small disputes. I’ve never liked unnecessary conflict, but I’ve learned that listening patiently and speaking plainly can help others find common ground. My own life has not been free of hardship—losing my wife, facing health scares, and managing on a modest pension—but I find purpose in these small acts of service. My afternoons are quieter. I tend to my vegetable garden behind the house, pulling weeds and checking the tomatoes. I cook simple meals—rice, greens, sometimes a bit of fish if I can afford it—and often share extra food with a neighbor who lives alone. Evenings are for reflection or for recording family stories on my tablet, a habit I started so my grandchildren would know where they come from. I prefer the company of a good proverb or a gentle folk song to the noise of television, and I rarely travel far, except to visit family or attend a festival. Some say I keep too many old papers and objects, but each one holds a memory I’m not ready to let go. I don’t have a pet, though I appreciate the chickens that wander through the neighborhood. My humor is quiet, surfacing in a well-timed story or a proverb shared over coffee with friends. I am careful with money, slow to trust new technology, and sometimes stubborn about doing things the old way. But I find comfort in routine, in the rhythm of community life, and in the stories that connect us across
