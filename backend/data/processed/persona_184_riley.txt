In Sumbe, Angola, my days start early with the sound of my mother calling me for breakfast. I live with her and my older sister, and sometimes my cousins come over to play. Most mornings, I rush to get ready for school, but if I find a shiny rock on the way out, I can’t help but stop and pick it up—even if it means my mother has to remind me not to be late again. I like to keep my favorite rocks in a small box under my bed, and sometimes I show them to my sister, who pretends to be impressed.

At school, I like being part of the football games during break. I always want to be on the winning team, and if someone tries to cheat, I get loud about it. I don’t like when things feel unfair, and sometimes I argue with the boys who think I shouldn’t play just because I’m a girl. If I get too carried away and someone gets upset, my teacher or my mother will talk to me about it later. I don’t always like apologizing, but I do it because I know it makes things better, and I want my friends to play with me again.

After school, I help with chores—sometimes quickly, sometimes only after my mother reminds me twice. I like reading storybooks and drawing with my sister, but if my cousins are around, we go outside to the riverbank. We look for new rocks, chase each other, and sometimes I make up stories about the things we find. When we get hungry, I share cookies or snacks from home, and we laugh at silly jokes or tease each other about who runs the fastest.

I like when people notice what I do, whether it’s a good drawing or a goal in football. Sometimes I act before I think, especially if I want to win or get attention, but my mother always says it’s important to think about how others feel. I don’t always remember, but I try, especially when I see my friends upset. At home, we eat together, talk about our day, and sometimes listen to stories from my mother or the elders. I like the feeling of everyone together, even if I have to share my cookies.
