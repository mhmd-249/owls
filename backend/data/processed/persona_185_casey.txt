I live and work on a remote research base, far from the rhythms of city life. Each morning, I wake to the hum of generators and the muted light filtering through reinforced windows. My days revolve around personal grooming—not in the sense of following trends, but in experimenting with whatever tools and supplies I can scrounge from the limited shipments that arrive every few months. I’ve always been drawn to self-styling, and here, improvisation is a necessity. I might fashion a hair mask from powdered milk and leftover coffee grounds, or repurpose lab gloves into makeshift hair ties. These small acts of creativity help me feel grounded and distinct, even when the world outside is nothing but ice and wind.

I document my evolving looks in a visual portfolio, snapping photos against the stark backdrop of the base. Instagram is my main outlet for sharing these experiments, though I rarely engage beyond posting. My style is unconventional—sometimes I’ll stitch together scraps of thermal fabric for a new accessory, or layer colors in ways that make sense only to me. I’m not interested in mainstream approval; the satisfaction comes from pushing the limits of what’s possible with so little.

Meals are simple: whatever can be thrown together from canned goods and dried staples. I enjoy the challenge of making something decent out of nearly nothing, just as I do with grooming. Coffee is a ritual, brewed strong and shared only with a close colleague or enjoyed alone during quiet hours. I prefer one-on-one conversations, finding large group dynamics draining and unnecessary.

Music is always playing in the background—ambient, experimental tracks with deep bass that echo the isolation here. I’m not much for gaming or tech hobbies; my hands are usually busy with scissors, fabric, or jotting down new ideas for styles. Privacy and autonomy matter to me, and I tend to keep to myself unless someone needs support or a bit of comfort in this harsh environment.
