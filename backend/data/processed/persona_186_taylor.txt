I live in Cayenne, the capital of French Guiana, where the tropical heat and sudden rains shape much of my day. At 14, I’m deep into high school, juggling classes and community projects that often bring me outside the classroom. Mornings can be a bit hectic—transportation isn’t always reliable, so I try to leave early, even if it means waiting in the humid air. Still, I like arriving on time; it feels respectful to my teachers and classmates, especially when we’re working on group assignments that need everyone’s input.

My family is a big part of my life. We live in a multigenerational household, which means there’s always someone around to share stories or help out. Dinner usually follows local traditions, with dishes that remind me of our diverse culture here. I’m careful about what I eat, trying to keep things healthy while honoring those family recipes. Sometimes, after school, I’ll join a football game with friends. It’s not just about the sport; it’s about teamwork and learning how to support each other, especially when things don’t go as planned.

At school, I’m drawn to projects about the environment and social fairness. We’ve been discussing how illegal mining affects our forests and rivers, and I find myself wanting to understand all sides—how people’s livelihoods depend on these activities, but also how the damage hurts our community. When we debate these topics, I try to listen carefully and make sure everyone’s voice is heard, even if opinions differ. It’s not always easy to stay calm, especially when emotions run high, but I remind myself that fairness means giving space to different views.

Technology helps me stay connected and learn more about these issues. I use it to research and sometimes to organize schedules for group work or community events. I’m still figuring out how to use it best, but I see it as a tool to help solve problems rather than just entertainment.

Evenings often find me reflecting quietly on the day—what went well, what could be better. I’m aware of the challenges around me, from the environment to social tensions, and I want to be part of solutions that respect both people and nature. For now, that means showing up, speaking up thoughtfully, and working alongside others who care about our community’s future.
