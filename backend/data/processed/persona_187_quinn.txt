In Al Wajh, on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, my days often begin before sunrise. I like to walk along the shoreline, the air still cool, reviewing the day’s production schedule in my head. The sea has a way of clearing my thoughts, which is necessary when I’m juggling the logistics of a film shoot—crew arrivals, equipment checks, and the inevitable last-minute changes that come with working in unpredictable locations. I’ve spent over two decades in film and documentary production here, drawn to stories that reflect the region’s evolving identity and the environmental challenges we face.

My work as an executive producer keeps me on the move, whether I’m scouting a new site in Tabuk or attending a festival in Jeddah. I rarely travel for leisure; every trip is purposeful, usually tied to a project or a chance to connect with other filmmakers. When I’m not on set, I’m often mentoring younger relatives or emerging talent from the community, usually over Arabic coffee or a simple meal of fresh local fish. I prefer understated clothes and practical routines—there’s little room for extravagance when you’re responsible for both creative vision and budget oversight.

Photography is more than a hobby; it’s a way to document fleeting moments on set or the subtle changes in the landscape that inspire my work. I enjoy reading about regional history and environmental issues, and I keep a journal where I sketch out ideas for future projects or jot down observations from the day. My evenings are usually spent with family, sharing stories and discussing the next generation’s ambitions. I don’t keep pets—my travel schedule wouldn’t allow it—and I have no patience for unnecessary luxury or pretense.

I’m known for being direct, sometimes to a fault, and I don’t shy away from creative risks, even when they complicate negotiations with clients or stakeholders. I avoid alcohol and stick to traditional foods, adapting to whatever is available on set. My faith shapes my routines and decisions, but I’m most at ease when I’m behind the camera, capturing the interplay of light and story in a place that’s always changing.
