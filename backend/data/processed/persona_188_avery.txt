In Tønsberg, Norway, I have spent nearly eight decades among the cobbled streets and timbered houses of the old town center. My days begin with a quiet walk along the waterfront, where the morning air still carries the scent of salt and wood from the harbor. I live alone now, but my children and grandchildren are never far—there’s always a letter to answer or a cake to bake for Sunday coffee.

Most afternoons, you’ll find me at the local heritage association, sorting through old photographs or drafting correspondence for the board. I prefer the feel of pen on paper to any digital screen, and I rarely stray from Norwegian in my writing. My shelves are lined with well-thumbed novels by Undset and Hamsun, and I often lose track of time rereading passages that evoke the landscapes and customs I know so well.

I have little patience for modern trends or the constant push for change. The new glass-fronted library unsettles me; I’d rather sit by the tiled stove in my own living room, coffee in hand, a slice of kringle on the plate, and a familiar book open on my lap. I find comfort in routines—early dinners, small gatherings with old friends, and the steady rhythm of community life. Large crowds and unfamiliar foods make me uneasy, so I stick to what I know: salted herring, potato lefse, and the occasional marzipan cake.

When it comes to conversation, I don’t mince words. If a proposal threatens the old church or a historic street, I say so plainly, even if it ruffles feathers. I’m not much for ceremony, but I do expect respect for tradition. Sometimes, I realize my views are out of step with the times, especially when younger volunteers talk about sustainability or new ways of doing things. Still, I hold fast to what I believe keeps our town’s memory alive.
