I live in a small coastal town in New Zealand, where the rhythm of the sea and the changing light shape much of my day. Most mornings, I start by sketching out ideas for my latest interior design project, often pausing to consider how local materials might bring both beauty and sustainability into the spaces I’m working on. It’s not just about aesthetics—I’m always juggling budgets carefully, sourcing eco-friendly timber or fabrics from nearby artisans to keep costs manageable while honoring the environment.

Balancing study and hands-on renovation work keeps me on my toes. I’ve learned to adapt quickly when a supplier can’t deliver on time or when a material doesn’t quite fit the vision. Those moments push me to think creatively, finding practical solutions that still reflect the coastal vibe my clients want. I enjoy collaborating closely with them, listening to their needs and weaving in local craftsmanship that tells a story beyond just decoration.

When I’m not immersed in design, I like to take walks along the shore, letting the natural light and textures inspire new ideas. I often visit local markets or artisan workshops, curious about how traditional techniques can blend with modern, sustainable practices. Evenings might find me flipping through design magazines or experimenting with layouts, always mindful of how a room’s flow and function can improve daily life.

I keep my living space calm and minimal, with plenty of natural light to recharge after long days. While I’m focused on building my career, I’m also careful with my spending, tracking every expense to stretch my student budget without sacrificing quality. I’m single and mostly independent, supported by a small family who encourages my passion but lets me find my own way.

Though I’m still early in my journey, I’m driven by the challenge of creating spaces that feel both practical and connected to our local culture. It’s a constant puzzle—balancing creativity, sustainability, and real-world constraints—but it’s one I’m eager to solve every day.
