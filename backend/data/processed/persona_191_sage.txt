In Charlotte Amalie, on the island of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, my days begin with the soft light filtering through my kitchen window and the familiar scent of herbal tea brewing. At 75, I live alone in a modest home adapted for comfort—no steep stairs, everything within easy reach. Most mornings, I stretch gently on my porch, listening to the neighborhood come alive. The air is always warm, sometimes heavy with the promise of rain, and I often spot neighbors heading to the market or greeting each other across fences.

Cooking is a daily ritual for me. I favor fresh local produce—okra, callaloo, sweet potatoes—and I’m always tweaking family recipes to make them a bit lighter or more nourishing. I keep a few pots of herbs by the window, snipping basil or thyme for soups and stews. Sometimes I bake coconut bread and share it with the neighbor’s grandchildren, who come by for stories about Carnival or old-time Charlotte Amalie. I enjoy these visits, though I’m particular about my routines and don’t like surprises in my schedule.

Volunteering at the community center keeps me connected. I help organize events and mentor young people, passing along the traditions and resilience that shaped my own life. I’m not one for online groups, but I use my phone to check in with family or look up new recipes. I prefer face-to-face conversations, especially over a cup of bush tea or during a walk to the local market.

I’m careful with my retirement income, planning for essentials but allowing myself the occasional treat—maybe a new book of Caribbean folktales or a short trip to visit cousins on another island. I keep my home tidy and practical, always looking for small ways to make things easier as I get older. I don’t have much patience for stereotypes about aging; I expect respect, and I give it in return. Some days I can be stubborn, especially about doing things my own way, but I’ve learned to ask for help when I need it. Most afternoons, you’ll find me tending my little garden, listening to calypso on the radio, or jotting down a new recipe to share at the next neighborhood gathering.
