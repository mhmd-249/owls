Living in my urban apartment in Louga, I start most mornings by feeding my small pet and taking a short walk around the neighborhood. These quiet moments help me clear my head before diving into the day’s work. My space is arranged to support both creative flow and technical focus, with dual monitors displaying Flash projects alongside open-source design tools. I’ve spent over six years honing my skills in Flash development, always aiming to craft interactive digital art that resonates with Senegalese culture and can function well even where internet access is limited.

My workday usually begins with reviewing project goals—often community-focused initiatives that blend storytelling with ethical technology. For example, I’m currently developing an educational flash game that highlights local geography and history, designed to run offline so students in rural areas can benefit. I prefer collaborating with small teams who share my commitment to transparency and responsible tech use, which means negotiating client expectations carefully to avoid shortcuts that compromise integrity.

Cooking is another part of my routine I don’t rush. I enjoy preparing home-cooked meals rooted in local recipes, finding that the process offers a creative outlet beyond the screen. Balancing this with my professional life means structuring my day around blocks of focused work, ethical reviews, and time set aside for learning new interactive design techniques or researching sustainable digital practices.

Outside work, I’m active in local meetups where we discuss ethical technology and creative innovation. These gatherings fuel my passion for digital media that honors cultural heritage while pushing boundaries. Though I’m fluent in Wolof and French, I use English primarily for international communication and technical documentation, which helps me connect with a broader community.

Evenings often find me tweaking code or experimenting with open-source tools, always mindful of how my projects can serve both artistic expression and social impact. My life here is a blend of creative challenge, cultural connection, and a steady commitment to doing work that matters beyond immediate gain.
