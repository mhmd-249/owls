I live and work in Berbérati, a place where community ties run deep and every day brings a mix of routine and unexpected challenges. As a customs declarer, my mornings often start with reviewing shipment documents and preparing for inspections. The tools I use—standard customs software and inspection protocols—are familiar companions, but the real test lies in balancing thoroughness with the pressure to clear goods quickly. Sometimes traders urge me to speed things up, but I’ve learned that cutting corners only invites problems down the line. I take my role seriously, knowing that what I allow through these gates affects not just the market but the people who depend on it.

Outside of work, I appreciate the quieter moments. I enjoy community gatherings where local customs are honored, and I often find myself drawn to stories that reflect real ethical dilemmas—those narratives remind me why integrity matters in my line of work. Chess is a pastime that fits well with my mindset; it sharpens my strategic thinking and patience, qualities I rely on when navigating the complexities of trade regulations and informal expectations. Occasionally, I’ll savor a cigar alongside a meal of local Central African cuisine, simple pleasures that ground me in my heritage.

Though I rarely travel beyond my professional duties within the Central African Republic, I stay connected to the rhythms of my community. Coffee breaks during meetings offer brief respites and chances to exchange news or discuss market conditions. I dress conservatively, favoring practicality over flair, which suits the environment where discretion and respect are valued.

At times, the tension between enforcing rules and maintaining good relationships with traders can be taxing. Yet, I find that clear, respectful communication helps bridge those gaps. My work is not just about following regulations but about protecting the stability and integrity of the market that supports so many lives here. When the day ends, I return to my family home, where the familiar surroundings remind me of the responsibilities I carry and the community I serve.
