In Mon Repos, Trinidad and Tobago, my days usually start with the sound of my little brother arguing over the bathroom and the smell of something spicy frying in the kitchen. I live with my parents and siblings in a small house, where everyone knows everyone’s business, and the neighbors are always around. After school, I’m usually out with friends—sometimes we head to the beach at Maracas if someone’s uncle is driving, or we just chill at the mall or hit the arcade in San Fernando. I like the noise and the energy of those places, and I always look forward to grabbing bake and shark or some other street food, especially if it’s got a bit of pepper.

Gaming is a big part of my evenings. As soon as homework’s done (or at least, done enough to keep my parents off my back), I’m online with my crew, playing shooters or sports games. We talk plenty of trash, but it’s all jokes, and it’s the best way to forget about any drama at home or school. I’m not really into planning things—if someone messages about a beach lime or a quick game, I’m there. I don’t bother much with clubs or volunteering, unless my family needs help with fishing or something. School is just something I get through, not something I think about too hard.

Music is always playing in the background—mostly soca or dancehall, whatever’s trending. I like the way it feels when everyone’s singing along, especially during Carnival or when we’re just hanging out. I don’t pay much attention to religion or deep questions; I just want to have a good time and keep things easy. If there’s trouble, I just move on and look for the next fun thing. That’s how it is for most of us around here—just living for the moment, with friends, food, and a little bit of freedom.
