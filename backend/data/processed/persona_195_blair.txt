I live in Puerto Píritu, Venezuela, where the days often start early and stretch long between school and work. Most mornings, I’m up before dawn, getting ready for classes while thinking about my shift at the local retail store later in the afternoon. Managing both school and work isn’t easy, especially when the power cuts out unexpectedly or the internet slows down during my online tutoring sessions. Still, I’ve learned to plan my day around these challenges, making sure I’m punctual and prepared even when things don’t go as planned.

At the store, I handle queues and talk with customers, trying to stay patient when the line gets long or when resources run low. It’s a small role, but it teaches me a lot about keeping calm under pressure and setting clear boundaries—like when I have to say no to extra shifts because I need time for schoolwork. When I’m not at the store or in class, I spend time tutoring online, helping younger students with their lessons. The connection isn’t always reliable, but I keep at it because it feels good to share what I know and to hear their stories.

I’m drawn to simple things—meals made from local ingredients, stories from my community that reflect both hardship and hope. Walking between school, work, and home gives me a chance to clear my head, and sometimes I play online games that let me connect with friends and unwind. I’m not one for big social groups; my ties are mostly with family and neighbors, and I prefer to keep my personal struggles private.

When things get tough, I try to stay practical. Instead of getting overwhelmed, I break problems down and figure out what I can do next. It’s not always easy, especially with the economic ups and downs here, but I keep moving forward, one step at a time.
