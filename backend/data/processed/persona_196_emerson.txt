I live in Kapsan-ŭp, a quiet town where the rhythm of daily life is shaped by the seasons and the land around us. My days begin early, often with the scent of herbs simmering on the stove as I prepare remedies passed down through my family. These plants, gathered carefully from nearby fields, are more than just ingredients—they’re a connection to the traditions that have sustained my community through many hardships.

Most mornings, I spend hours working with those who come seeking relief. My hands move steadily, applying manual therapy techniques learned over years, adapting when supplies run low by turning to local plants and simple tools. It’s demanding work, both physically and emotionally, especially when I balance it with caring for my family. There’s little room for rest, but I find moments of calm in the quiet after midday, when I can sit with a cup of herbal tea and listen to soft traditional music, letting the day’s weight settle.

I don’t chase the latest technologies or trends; my focus remains on what’s practical and reliable. When a client struggles, I draw on more than just physical treatments—I offer steady emotional support, knowing that healing often requires patience and understanding as much as skill. Sometimes, I share stories from my own experience, hoping they’ll find strength in knowing they’re not alone.

Evenings are for reflection and preparation. I carefully plan the next day’s remedies, mindful of the scarcity we face, always seeking sustainable ways to use what nature provides. My diet mirrors this simplicity—mostly plant-based foods sourced locally, avoiding anything processed. It feels right to nourish the body with what the land offers, just as I do in my work.

Though the challenges are many, I keep to my routines, steady and unyielding. The community here depends on each other, and I take my place quietly, offering what I can: healing hands, a listening ear, and the resilience to carry on.
