I live in Taleigao, Goa, where the rhythms of local life blend with the steady demands of my work in supply chain management. My days begin early, often with a careful review of reports that track every movement in the logistics network I oversee. I insist on strict check-ins with my team, not because I distrust them, but because I believe that control and clear lines of authority keep operations running smoothly. When I visit vendors, I’m meticulous—every detail matters, from delivery times to product quality. It’s this attention to hierarchy and order that has shaped my career over more than thirty years.

I’m cautious about new technology. While others rush to adopt the latest digital tools, I prefer methods that let me maintain a firm grip on processes. Manual checks and rigid schedules might seem old-fashioned, but they give me the confidence that nothing slips through the cracks. This approach extends beyond work; I’m conservative with my personal finances, favoring secure investments over risky ventures. It’s a mindset that has served me well, even if it means I’m slower to embrace change.

Outside the office, I keep to myself more than most. My leisure time is often spent reading industry reports or catching up on local news rather than socializing. I enjoy strategic board games—they challenge my planning skills and let me unwind while still engaging my mind. Meals are simple and familiar, usually traditional Goan dishes that remind me of home and routine.

I’m aware that my insistence on control and hierarchy can make collaboration difficult. I prefer clear roles and responsibilities rather than open-ended teamwork. Aging hasn’t softened this; if anything, it has reinforced my belief that vigilance and discipline are necessary to stay relevant. Each evening, after ensuring everything is in order, I prepare for the next day, knowing that maintaining this structure is what keeps both my work and life steady.
